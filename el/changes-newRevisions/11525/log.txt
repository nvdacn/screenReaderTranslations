    Support for editing of rich text in Google Chrome and Chrome-based browsers such as Google Docs with braille support enabled.
    
    This requires Chrome 47 or later.
    As part of this, unify common code for web browsers exposing IAccessible2 into a new ia2Web module and use it for Mozilla and Chromium.
    Fixes #2634.
