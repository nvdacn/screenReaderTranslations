    When using a braille display and text is selected on the current line (e.g. when searching in a text editor for text which occurs on the same line), the braille display will be scrolled if appropriate.
    
    On a pending caret move if there is no cursor, try to scroll the braille display to the selection.
    
    * Move the marking of a selection to braille.Region.
    * Add Region.brailleSelectionStart/End.
    * If there is a selection but not a cursor, e.g. in a TextInfoRegion, scroll the braille display to the selection start.
    
    Fixes #5410.
