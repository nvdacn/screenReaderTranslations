NVDA is developed by [NV Access -{http://www.nvaccess.org/],}- +{https://www.nvaccess.org/],}+ with contributions from the community.

If you don't hear any of this, or you hear the Windows error sound, or a descending set of tones, then this means that NVDA has an error, and you will need to possibly report a bug to the developers.
Please check out the NVDA website for how to do this.

When NVDA starts for the first time, you will be greeted by a dialog box which provides you with some basic information about the NVDA modifier key and the NVDA menu.
(Please see further sections about these topics.)


The dialog box also contains a -{combobox}- +{combo box}+ and three checkboxes.
The -{combobox}- +{combo box}+ lets you select the keyboard layout.
The first checkbox lets you control if NVDA should use the capslock as an NVDA modifier key.
The second specifies whether NVDA should start automatically after you log on to Windows and is only available for installed copies of NVDA.
The third lets you control if this Welcome dialog should appear each time NVDA starts.
