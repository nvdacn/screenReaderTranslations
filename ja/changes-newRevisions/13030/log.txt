    Update changes file for PR #6558
    
    - The minimum braille cursor blink rate is now 200ms. Profiles or configurations with values below this will be increased to 200ms. (Issue #6470)
    - A check box has been added to the braille settings dialog to allow enabling/disabling braille cursor blinking. Previously a value of zero was used to achieve this. (Issue #6470)
    - Profiles and configuration files are now automatically upgraded to meet the requirements of schema modifications. If there is an error during upgrade, a notification is shown, the configuration is reset, and the old configuration file is available in the NVDA log at 'Info' level. (Issue #6470)
