    In Internet Explorer, the shoprite.com website can now be read in browse mode instead of reporting as blank. (Specifically, malformed lang attributes are now handled gracefully.)
    
    Normally, the lang attribute should only contain specific characters, but it's entirely possible for an author to break this as is the case on this site. We must XML escape the language to avoid complete breakage where this happens.
    Fixes #5569.
