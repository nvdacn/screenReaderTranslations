    In browse mode, nonsensical text (sometimes spanning several lines) is no longer presented for certain graphics such as found on Google Groups. (Specifically, this occurred with base64 encoded images.)
    
    When determining a name from a URL, we now just return an empty string if the URL starts with data:image/.
    Fixes #4793.
