message:
  In Windows Vista and later, NVDA no longer incorrectly treats the Windows key as being held down when unlocking Windows after locking it by pressing Windows+l.
  To fix this, NVDA's recorded modifiers are cleared when switching to a secure desktop, as we don't receive key ups for any keys down before the switch.
