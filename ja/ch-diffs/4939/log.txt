message:
  mozilla.GeckoPluginWindowRoot NVDAObject: In Gecko >= 11, the window wrapping the plugin window doesn't expose a Gecko accessible like it used to, so skip it.
  This means that in Firefox 11, the move to containing virtual buffer command (NVDA+control+space) now works as it should to escape embedded objects such as Flash content.
