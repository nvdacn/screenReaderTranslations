message:
  Merged touchSupport branch. Adds experimental support for touch screens on Windows 8. This includes reading text directly under your finger when moving it around the screen, gestures for object navigation, text review and other NVDA commands. This may not be feature complete, but should be stable enough and provides at least basic touch screen use.
