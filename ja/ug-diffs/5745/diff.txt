+++ Papenmeier Braille BRAILLEX Older Models ++
+The following Braille displays are supported: 
+- BRAILLEX EL 80, EL 2D-80, EL 40 P
+- BRAILLEX Tiny, 2D Screen
+-
+
+Note that these displays can only be connected via a serial port.
+Therefore, you should select the port to which the display is connected after you have choosen this driver in the Braille Settings dialogue.
+
+Some of these devices have an Easy Access Bar (EAB) that allows intuitive and fast operation.
+The EAB can be moved in four directions where generally each direction has two switches.
+Pressing and holding the up, down, right and left keys (or EAB) causes the corresponding action to be repeated.
+Older devices do not have an EAB; front keys are used instead.
+

+| l2 | Left rear key |
+| r1 | Right front key |
+| r2 | Right rear key |
