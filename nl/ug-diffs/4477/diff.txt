 When you move to an object, NVDA will report it similarly to the way it reports the system focus.
 For a way to review all text as it appears on the screen, you can instead use [flat review #FlatReview].

+Rather than having to move back and forth between every single object on the system, the objects are organized hierarchically.
 This means that some objects contain other objects and you must move inside them to access the objects they contain.
 For example, a list contains list items, so you must move inside the list in order to access its items.
 If you have moved to a list item, you can move to its containing object to get back to the list and then move past it if you wish.

+==== Say "cap" before capitals ====
+This setting is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to say the word "cap" before any capital letter when spoken as an individual character such as when spelling.
 Usually, NVDA raises the pitch slightly for any capital letter, but some synthesizers may not support this well, so perhaps this option may be of use.
