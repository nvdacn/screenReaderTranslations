 When you move to an object, NVDA will report it similarly to the way it reports the system focus.
 For a way to review all text as it appears on the screen, you can instead use [flat review #FlatReview].
 
-Rather than having to move back and forth between every single object on the system, the objects are grouped hierarchically.
-This means that you must move inside some objects to access the objects they contain.
-For example, instead of moving through all list items when a list is encountered, you must move inside the list (i.e. navigate to its first child object) in order to access its items.
-You can move out of the list (navigate to the parent object) to continue past the list.
-Similarly, if you encounter a toolbar, you must move inside the toolbar (navigate to its first child) to access the controls in the toolbar.

 The object currently being reviewed is called the navigator object.
 Once you navigate to an object, you can review it using the [text review commands #ReviewingText].
