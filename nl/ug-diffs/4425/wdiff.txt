When you move to an object, NVDA will report it similarly to the way it reports the system focus.
For a way to review all text as it appears on the screen, you can instead use [flat review #FlatReview].






Rather than having to move back and forth between every single object on the system, the objects are 
-{grouped}-
 
+{organised}+
 hierarchically.
This means that 
+{some objects contain other objects and}+
 you must move inside 
-{some objects}-
 
+{them}+
 to access the objects they contain.
For example, 
-{instead of moving through all list items when}-
 a list 
-{is encountered,}-
 
+{contains list items, so}+
 you must move inside the list 
-{(i.e. navigate to its first child object)}-
 in order to access its items.

 can move

 to 
-{the parent object)}-
 
+{its containing object to get back}+
 to 
-{continue past}-
 the 
-{list.}-
 
+{list and then move past it if you wish.}+

Similarly, if you encounter a toolbar, you must move inside the toolbar 
-{(navigate to its first child)}-
 to access the controls in the toolbar.

The object currently being reviewed is called the navigator object.
Once you navigate to an object, you can review it using the [text review commands #ReviewingText].
