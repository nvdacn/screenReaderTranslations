 NVDA currently comes with two sets of key commands.
 There is a layout for Desktops and a layout for Laptops.

 Although most laptops do not have a physical numberpad, some laptops can emulate one by holding down the FN key and pressing letters and numbers on the right-hand side of the keyboard (7 8 9 u i o j k l etc).
 If your laptop can not do this, or does not allow you to turn numlock off, you may want to switch to the Laptop layout instead.
 
+++ NVDA Touch Gestures ++
+If you are running NVDA on a device with a touch screen, and its running Windows 8 or higher, you can also control NVDA directly via the touch screen.
+While NVDA is running, all touch input will go directly to NVDA. 
+Therefore, actions that can be performed normally without NVDA will not work.
+
++++ Exploring the Screen +++
+The most basic action you can perform with the touch screen is to announce the control or text at any point on the screen.
+To do this, place one finger anywhere on the screen.
+You can also keep your finger on the screen and move it around to read other controls and text that your finger moves over.
+
++++ Touch Gestures +++
+When NVDA commands are described further along in this user guide, they may list a touch gesture which can be used to activate that command with the touch screen.
+Following are some instructions on how to perform the various touch gestures required to perform  NVDA commands with a touch screen.
+==== Taps ====
+Tap the screen quickly with one or more fingers.
+
+Tapping once with one  finger is simpley known as a tap.
+Tapping with 2 fingers at the same time is a 2-finger tap, and so on.
+
+If the same tap is performed one or more times again in quick succession, NVDA will instead see a special multi-tap gesture.
+Tapping twice will result in a double tap.
+Tapping 3 times will result in a tripple tap, and so on.
+Of course these multi-tap gestures also recognize how many fingers were used, so its possible to have gestures like a 2-finger tripple tap, or a 4-finger tap, etc. 
+ 
+ ==== Flicks ====
+Quickly swipe your finger across the screen.
+
+There are 4 possible flick gestures depending on the direction: flick left, flick right, flick up, and flick down.
+
+Just like taps, more than one finger can be used to perform the gesture.
+Therefore gestures such as 2-finger flick up or 4-finger flick left are all possible.
+
++++ Touch Modes +++
+As there are many more NVDA commands then there are possible touch gestures, NVDA has several touch modes you can switch between, which makes certain subsets of commands available.
+The two modes that exist for now are text mode and object mode. 
+Certain NVDA commands listed in this document may have a touch mode listed in brackets after the touch gesture.
+For example: flick up (text mode) means that the command will be performed if you flick up, but only while in text mode.
+If the command does not have a mode associated with it, it will work in any mode.
+
+%kc:beginInclude
+To toggle touch modes, perform a 3-finger tap.
+%kc:endInclude
+
+ ++ Input Help Mode ++
+Many key and touch commands are mentioned through out the rest of this user guide, but an easy way to explore all the different commands is to turn on input help.
+
+To turn on input help, press NVDA+1.
+To turn it off, press NVDA+1 again.
+While in input help, pressing any key or performing any touch gesture will report the action and describe what it does (if indeed it does do something).
+The actual  commands will not execute while in input help mode.
+
 ++ The NVDA menu ++
 The NVDA menu allows you to control NVDA's settings, access help, save/revert your configuration, Modify speech dictionaries, access additional tools and exit NVDA.
 
-To get to the NVDA menu from anywhere in Windows while NVDA is running, press NVDA+n.
+To get to the NVDA menu from anywhere in Windows while NVDA is running, press NVDA+n on the keyboard, or perform a 2-finger double tap on a touch screen.
 You can also get to the NVDA menu via the windows system tray.
 Either right-click on the NVDA icon located in the system tray, or access the system tray by pressing the windows logo key+B, DownArrow to the NVDA icon and press the applications key located next to the right control key on most keyboards.
 When the menu comes up, You can use the arrow keys to navigate the menu, and the enter key to activate an item.
