  Merged autolanguageSwitching branch and updated user guide. Implements #845. This branch provides NVDA with the ability to automatically switch languages on the fly when reading documents that have been marked up with appropriate language attributes. Browse mode documents in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, pdfs in Adobe Reader, browse mode documents in Mozilla Gecko (firefox etc), and any other documents exposed by IAccessible2 and the IAccessible2 language attribute are supported.  So far eSpeak is the only speech synthesizer that will support these automatic language changes. Note that this only works with explicit language information in documents, NVDA does not detect the language based on the characters.
