 allows you to review the entire content of a document or the text of the screen as it appears visually.
This is called flat review.
This is similar to the screen review or mouse cursor functionality in many other Windows screen readers.


When you 
-{switch}-
 
+{move}+
 to flat review, you will be positioned at the location of the current [navigator object #ObjectNavigation].
If you haven't used object navigation, this will usually be the object that has the [focus #SystemFocus].
For example, if the navigator object was a button, you will usually be positioned on the text of the button in flat review.
You can then review the text using the [text review commands #ReviewingText].
