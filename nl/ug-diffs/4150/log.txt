  Merged character descriptions branch (#55). This implements support in NVDA to hear a description or examples of a given character. Pressing review current character twice will provide a description of the character under the review cursor. Pressing review current word or review current line three times will spell the word or line but using descriptions.  So far descriptions for english, french and traditional Chinese (Taiwan) have been added. Descriptions are chosen based on NVDA's current locale and or the English locale. In future we may consider tying this to the synth's current language. This implementation is especially important to Asian languages as it now provides them with a way to have example phraises spoken for a given symbol, as for in Chinese, many symbols can sound the same but have different meanings.
