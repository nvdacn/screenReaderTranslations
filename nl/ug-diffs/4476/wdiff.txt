If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will make a small beep each time it encounters a capitalized character by itself.
Like the 'say cap for capitals' checkbox, this is useful for Synthesizers that can't change their pitch for capital letters.


+{==== Use spelling functionality if supported ====[VoiceSpellingFunctionality]
Some words consist of only one character, but the pronunciation is different depending on whether the character is being spoken as an individual character (such as when spelling) or a word.
For example, in English, "a" is both a letter and a word.
