- In the Windows Creaters Update, NVDA's audio ducking again works as in previous Windows releases (I.e. Duck with speech and sounds, always duck, and no ducking are all available). (#6933)
- NVDA will no longer fail to navigate to or report certain (UIA) controls where a keyboard shortcut is not defined. (#6779)
- Two empty spaces are no longer added in keyboard shortcut information for certain (UIA) controls. (#6790)
+{- Certain combinations of keys on HIMS displays (e.g. space+dot4) no longer fail intermittently. (#3157)}+


== Changes for Developers ==
- Commandline arguments are now processed with Python's argparser module, rather than optparser. This allows certain options such as -r and -q to be handled exclusively. (#6865)

- core.callLater now queues the callback to NVDA's main queue after the given delay, rather than waking the core and executing it directly. This stops possible freezes due to the  core accidentally going to sleep after processing a callback, in the midle of  a modal call such as the desplaying of a message box. (#6797)
+{- The InputGesture.identifiers property has been changed so that it is no longer normalized. (#6945)
 - Subclasses no longer need to normalize identifiers before returning them from this property.
 - If you want normalized identifiers, there is now an InputGesture.normalizedIdentifiers property which normalizes the identifiers returned by the identifiers property .
- The InputGesture.logIdentifier property is now deprecated. Callers should use InputGesture.identifiers[0] instead. (#6945)}+
