message:
  NVDA can now detect formatting in display models. This includes font name, font size, bold, italic, underline and color.
  This information is saved in to the model along with text chunks when they are written, and  displayModel's getwindowTextInRect now can give back XML including the formatting.
  GetTextWithFields has been implemented on the DisplayModelTextInfo class  so that it pfetches and processes the XML, producing text and format fields.
  speech.getcontrolFieldSpeech also no lo longer treets the _childcount attribute as manditory.
