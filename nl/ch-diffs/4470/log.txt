message:
  colors.RGB.name: once finding the closest color, do not cache  it in the RGBToNames dictionary, instead cache it in a separate dictionary spcific for caching. Previously the more colors that NVDA found, the more inaccurate it was becoming as the closest color was in many cases a color that was previously found to be close to another. also rewrite the algorithm to possibly read a bit better by using a for loop rather than sort and a lambda etc.
