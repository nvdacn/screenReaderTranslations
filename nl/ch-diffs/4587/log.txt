message:
  It seems that UIA combo boxes don't necessarily expose the Value pattern unless they take arbitrary text values. Therefore, obtain the value using the name of the selected item and make items fire a valueChange event on the combo box when they are selected.
  Fixes reporting of the value for WPF (and possibly some other UI Automation) combo boxes which do not allow text editing.
