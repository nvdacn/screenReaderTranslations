message:
  MSHTMLTextInfo._expandToLine: textRange.select() sometimes throws focus onto the document for some unfathomable reason, so instead, create a new range from the selection and move the selection using that.
  Fixes a rare problem where the focus kept bouncing infinitely between the document and a multi-line editable text field in focus mode.
