message:
  ExcelWorksheet NVDAObject: Don't implement initOverlayClass, as this is never used as an overlay class.
  ExcelCell NVDAObject: Use __gestures instead of binding in initOverlayClass, as this is never used as an overlay class, so initOverlayClass is never called. (We could just bind in the constructor, but __gestures looks nicer.)
