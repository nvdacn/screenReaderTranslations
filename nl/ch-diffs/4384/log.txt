  Excel NVDAObjects:
  	* Move duplicate code used to fire a focus event on the active selection into ExcelBase.
  	* ExcelBase.getCellAddress: Don't use a regexp to strip the dollar signs. Instead, just request non-absolute references from Excel.
  	* Implement equality check for ExcelWorksheet and fix equality check for ExcelCell so that these objects are correctly identified as being unequal if the sheet is different.
  	* Bind control+pageUp/pageDown to changeSelection script so that changing sheets is reported.
  	* Remove doc string from changeSelection script, as it is an application provided command and the text didn't cover all cases in which it is used.
