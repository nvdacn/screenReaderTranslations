-++ Flat Review ++[FlatReview]
-While you can generally only review the content of a single [object #Objects], some objects allow you to review the content of objects inside them.
-Complex documents allow you to review their entire content and application windows allow you to review the text of the screen as it appears visually.
-This is called flat review.
-This is similar to the screen review or mouse cursor functionality in many other Windows screen readers.

-When you move to flat review, you will be positioned at the location of the current [navigator object #ObjectNavigation].
-If you haven't used object navigation, this will usually be the object that has the [focus #SystemFocus].
-For example, if the navigator object was a button, you will usually be positioned on the text of the button in flat review.
-You can then review the text using the [text review commands #ReviewingText].
-You can also navigate directly to the object encompassing the current position of the review cursor, allowing you to use [object navigation #ObjectNavigation] from there.
