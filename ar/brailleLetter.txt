request to schools and organisations:

We are grateful if you could install NVDA and make this free open source screen-reader available to your users as part of the service that you provide.
If you can reduce the number of licences for other screen-readers, and instead introduce NVDA as an alternative, with the money saved we would like to strongly encourage you to buy braille displays.
Having access to a braille display will provide many new opportunities for the blind user, and they can slowly be encouraged towards mathematics and the sciences. We believe that no subject should be difficult to the blind as long as they are provided with the right support and patients.
Not only will they be able to participate, but we believe that blind members of the community can be leaders in their fields.
 
Blind individuals in the west with the correct training and support are doing excellent work, and we believe that if we give the Chance to the Arabic blind user then they can full fill many roles that in the past was seen as unavailable to us.
 
There are many famous blind people, both Arabic and foreign, and we can use them as role models for us.

Please remember that all members of the Arabic translation team are blind, and most of the developers of the English branch are also blind. 

So help us to build a better future for the Arabic world.
 

Thank you,

The Arabic translation team.
