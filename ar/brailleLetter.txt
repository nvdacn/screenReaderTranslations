request to schools and organizations:

We are grateful if you could install NVDA and make this free open source screenreader available to your users as part of the service that you provide.
If you can reduce the number of licances for other screenreaders, and instead introduce NVDA as an alternative, with the money saved we would like to strongly encourage you to buy braille displays.
Having access to a braille display will provide many new opportunaties for the blind user, and they can slowly be encouraged towards mathematics and the sciences. We believe that no subject should be dificult to the blind as long as they are provided with the right support and patiants.
Not only will they be able to partisipate, but we believe that blind members of the community can be leaders in their fields.
 
Blind individuals in the west with the correct training and support are doing excellent work, and we believe that if we give the chanse to the arabic blind user then they can fullfill many roles that in the past was seen as unavailable to us.
 
There are many famous blind people, both arabic and forign, and we can use them as role models for us.

Please remember that all members of the arabic translation team are blind, and most of the developers of the English branch are also blind. 

So help us to build a better future for the arabic world.
 

Thank you,

The arabic translation team.
