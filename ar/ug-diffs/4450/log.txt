message:
  The reportcurrentformatting script (NVDA+f) now reports formatting at the position of the review cursor, rather than the system caret. for most people this will not affect them as by default the review cursor follows the system caret. However, for those wishing to detect formatting when moving the review cursor, such as in flat review, this is useful.
