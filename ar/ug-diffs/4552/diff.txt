 Thus, if you do use alt in a gesture, pressing this key combination may activate the menu bar, as well as executing the script.

+++ Advanced Customization of Symbol Pronunciation ++
+It is possible to customize the pronunciation of punctuation and other symbols beyond what can be done using the [Punctuation/symbol pronunciation #SymbolPronunciation] dialog.
+For example, you can specify whether the raw symbol should be sent to the synthesizer (e.g. to cause a pause or change in inflection) and you can add custom symbols.
+
+To do this, you must edit the symbol pronunciation information file in your NVDA user configuration directory.
+The file is called symbols-xx.dic, where xx is the language code.
+The format of this file is documented in the Symbol Pronunciation section of the NVDA Developer Guide, which is available from [the Development section of the NVDA web site NVDA_URLwiki/Development].
+However, it is not possible for users to define complex symbols.
