message:
  New handling of symbol pronunciation, including multiple punctuation/symbol levels, locale specific symbol info and proper announcement of repeated symbols.
  Translators will need to provide translated symbol pronunciations. This is no longer handled by gettext, so if this isn't done, symbols will be spoken in English. See the Symbol Pronunciation of the Developer Guide for details on how to do this.
