message:
  Fix flat review keyboard commands for laptop layout.
  Previously, the desktop keys were removed and the documented keys included the alt key, which caused the menu bar to activate. The keys (which were previously present but undocumented) are now NVDA+pageUp and NVDA+pageDown.
  Also some minor cosmetic fixes.
