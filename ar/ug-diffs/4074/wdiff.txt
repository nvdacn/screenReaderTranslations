Gesture identifiers consist of a two leter device code (kb for keyboard and br for braille display), an optional sub-device or keyboard layout in brackets, a colon, and then one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.
 
Pressing keys while in Input help and then viewing the log will enable you to discover the gesture identifiers to use.

+{Although you are free to have scripts bound to any available key, it may be problematic to use the keyboard alt key.
NVDA still sends modifier keys (such as shift, control and alt) to the Operating System, even if they eventuate in a script.
Thus, if you do use alt in a gesture, pressing this key combination may activate the menu bar, as well as execute the script.
Therefore, its probably best to just use Shift, control and the NVDA modifier key as modifiers.}+
