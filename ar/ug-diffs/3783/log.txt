  English User Guide: Supported Speech Synthesizers:
  	* eSpeak: Remove mention of SAPI runtime, as this won't make sense to most users.
  	* SAPI 4/5: There should be a space between SAPI and the number, so add it.
  	* SAPI 4: Add link to SAPI 4 runtime binaries.
  	* AudioLogic: Rename to Audiologic Tts3, which is the full name of the synth. Also clarify that it must be installed on the system.
  	* Add info about Newfon.
  	* Other minor fixes.
