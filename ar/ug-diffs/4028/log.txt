message:
  Implement a configuration setting that can again restore the old functionality of announcing position information even if it is rather inaccurate (i.e. resorting to MSAA child ID and parent's accChildCount). Fixes #966. Specifically:
  	* Added a guessObjectPositionInformationWhenUnavailable boolean to the presentation section of nvda.ini (set to false by default).
  	* Added a checkbox to the Object Presentation dialog for toggling this setting.
  	* Made the 'allowIAccessibleChildIDAndChildCountForPositionInfo' IAccessible NVDAObject class variable in to a property guetter, and return the value of the guessObjectPositionInformationWhenUnavailable setting.
  	* Updated the user guide to mention this setting.
