  English User Guide:
  	* Rename "Advanced Tools for Developers" to "Extra Tools", as the Speech Viewer isn't just for developers, among other reasons.
  	* Remove the detailed info about the Python Console, as it's not really useful to most users (and thus not relevant to the User Guide). Instead, provide a link to the article on the NVDA web site.
  	* Slight change to the mention of the Tools menu.
