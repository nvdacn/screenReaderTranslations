++ Browse Mode +
+Complex read-only documents such as web pages are browsed in NVDA using browse mode.
+This includes documents in Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash.
+
+In browse mode, the content of the document is made available in a flat representation that can be navigated with the cursor keys as if it were a normal text document.
+All of NVDA's system caret key commands will work in this mode; e.g. say all, report formatting, table navigation commands, etc.
+Information such as whether text is a link, heading, etc. is announced along with the text as you move.
+
+Sometimes, you will need to interact directly with controls in these documents.
+You do this by switching to focus mode, where all keys are passed to the control.
+When in Browse mode, by default, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it.
+Conversely, tabbing to or clicking on a control that does not require focus mode will switch back to browse mode.
+You can also press enter or space to switch to focus mode on controls that require it.
+Pressing escape will switch back to browse mode.
+In addition, you can manually force focus mode, after which it will remain in effect until you choose to disable it.
 
-A virtual buffer is a flat representation of content such as a web page, that can be moved around in with the arrow keys.
-Information such as whether text is a link, heading etc is announced along with the text as you move.
-
-While in a virtual buffer, there are two modes of interaction.
-Browse mode is where you can move around all the text using a virtual cursor, rather like the system caret.
-In fact all of NVDA's system caret key commands will work in this mode (e.g. say all, report formatting, all table navigation commands etc).
-Focus mode is where you can directly interact with the control (edit field, combo box, radio buttons) using what ever keys you would normally use.
-When in Browse mode, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it.
-Note that pressing enter or space on controls that require it will also switch to focus mode.
-If NVDA has automatically switched to focus mode, tabbing to, or clicking on, an object that does not need focus mode (such as a link or peace of text) will switch back to browse mode.
-Pressing escape will also switch back to browse mode if it was switched to focus mode automatically.
-You can manually change between focus and browse modes as well.
-Though when changing to focus mode manually, NVDA will lock to that particular mode and no longer automatically switch, unless you manually change back to browse mode.
