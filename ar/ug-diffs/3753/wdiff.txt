++ Speech Synthesizer Support ++

Apart from providing its messages and interface in several languages, NVDA can also enable the user to read content in any language, as long as they have a speech synthesizer that can speak that

 language.

NVDA is bundled with [eSpeak http://espeak.sourceforge.net/], a free, open-source, multi-lingual speech synthesizer. Additionally, NVDA can use both SAPI4 and SAPI5 speech engines to provide speech output, as well as the Audiologic and NewFon speech synthesizers.
