  English user guide: add a subsection to the Document Formatting settings section, for the Announce Formatting Changes after the Cursor option. Also change the word 'All' to 'Most' in the top paragraph of the Document Formatting Settings section, as not 'all' checkboxes are used to configure specific format types. Also remove the mention of Wordpad and Microsoft Word from the top sentence of the Document Formatting Settings section as formatting is definitly supported any many other places.
