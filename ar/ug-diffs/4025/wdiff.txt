If you have the portable version of NVDA, then all you have to do is to press enter or double click on the file, and follow the prompts.
It will ask you where on your system you wish to place the files.


+{+++ NVDA Portable on a USB key +++
It is possible to place NVDA on a USB thumb drive so that you can use it on other computer systems.

When the Portable version asks where you wish to unpack it to, type in the drive of your USB thumb drive, plus an optional subdirectory, where you wish to place NVDA.

If for example your USB thumb drive is at E:\, you might wish to type in E:\nvda, which will place NVDA in the NVDA subdirectory on your USB thumb drive.

Note that although this now means you can carry around NVDA and its settings with you anywhere, simply plugging in the USB thumb drive will not automatically start NVDA; You will have to start NVDA manually from either Windows Explorer or the Run Dialog.

Due to differences in USB thumb drives, and differences in Operating System security, either there may be more steps you will need to take to allow auto starting, or perhaps Windows and your USB thumb drive may not support this feature at all.
