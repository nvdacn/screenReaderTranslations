+++ Remapping Key Assignments and Other Input Gestures ++
 Users are able to provide or override mappings of input gestures (such as key presses) to scripts in a special file in the user's NVDA configuration directory.
 This file is called gestures.ini.
 
 This file uses standard ini syntax.
-Each section provides mappings for scripts in a particular Python module and class inside NVDA.
-The section name should be the Python module and class separated by a dot (.).
- 
- The keys of each section are the names of the scripts you wish to bind to.
- The value of each key is a comma (,) separated list of gesture identifiers which represent the various input gestures that should be bound to that particular script.
-
-Multiple keys can be provided for each section, and multiple sections can be provided in the file.
+The file may contain multiple sections and each section may have one or more entries.
 
-In order to find out gesture identifiers as well as the names of scripts and the class and module in which they are contained, you can turn on Input Help, activate the gesture (press the key) and, after turning off Input help, activate View log in the tools menu and examine the recent log entries.

+Alternatively, you can use None to unbind input gestures from a script to which they were previously bound.

+In order to discover gesture identifiers, script names and the class and module in which they are contained, you can:
++ Turn on Input Help.
++ Activate the gesture (press the key).
++ Turn off input help.
++ Activate View log in the NVDA Tools menu.
++ Examine the recent log entries.
 One of these should provide information about the input gesture you sent, including the module.class and script if it is bound to one.

 Following is an example of how you could bind NVDA+shift+t to the date time script.

 This would bind the key press NVDA+shift+t (in any keyboard layout) to the dateTime script.
 
-You can also use the special script name of None to unbind an input gesture from whatever script it was bound to in that module and class.

 Gesture identifiers consist of a two leter device code (kb for keyboard and br for braille display), an optional sub-device or keyboard layout in brackets, a colon, and then one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.
  
 Pressing keys while in Input help and then viewing the log will enable you to discover the gesture identifiers to use.
