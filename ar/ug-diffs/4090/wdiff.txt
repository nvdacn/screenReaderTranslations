 and Other Input Gestures ++
Users are able to provide or override mappings of input gestures (such as key presses) to scripts in a special file in the user's NVDA configuration directory.
This file is called gestures.ini.

This file uses standard ini syntax.

Each section provides mappings for scripts in a particular Python module and class inside NVDA.

This would bind the key press NVDA+shift+t (in any keyboard layout) to the dateTime script.


-{You can also use the special script name of None to unbind an input gesture from whatever script it was bound to in that module and class.}-




Gesture identifiers consist of a two leter device code (kb for keyboard and br for braille display), an optional sub-device or keyboard layout in brackets, a colon, and then one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.
 
Pressing keys while in Input help and then viewing the log will enable you to discover the gesture identifiers to use.
