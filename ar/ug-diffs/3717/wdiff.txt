When NVDA announces an object (e.g. when it receives the System focus), it will usually say the object's name, type, state, value, description, keyboard shortcut, and positional information. This is quite similar to other screen readers; however the types of objects may be a little different.

There are some key commands that are useful when moving with the System focus:

+{%kc:beginInclude}+

++ Navigating with the System Caret ++
When the focus is on an object that has an edit cursor (system caret), you can arrow around and edit like you normally would. NVDA will announce as you move by character, word, line, and will also announce selecting and unselecting text.

NVDA provides the following key commands in relation to the system caret:

+{%kc:beginInclude}+

|| Name | Key | Description |
| Say all | NVDA+downArrow | Starts reading from the current position of the system caret, moving it along as it goes |
