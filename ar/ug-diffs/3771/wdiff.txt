++ eSpeak ++
The eSpeak synthesizer is built directly in to NVDA, and does not depend on any other special drivers or SAPI runtime to be installed.
NVDA starts using eSpeak by default.
As this synthesizer is built in to NVDA, this is a great choice for when running NVDA off a USB thumb drive or CD on other systems.

Each voice that comes with eSpeak speaks a different language.
There are over 20 different languages supported by eSpeak.

There are also many variants which can be chosen, to make the sound of the voice quite different.

++ Microsoft Speech API version 4 (SAPI4) ++
SAPI4 is an older Microsoft standard for software speech synthesizers.
Many speech synthesizers that comply to this standard may be  purchased or downloaded for free from various companies and websites.
When using this synthesizer with NVDA, the available voices (accessed from the [Voice Settings dialog #VoiceSettings], or by the [Synth Settins Ring #SynthSettingsRing]) will contain all the voices from all the installed SAPI4 engines found on your system.

++ Microsoft Speech API version 5 (SAPI5) ++
SAPI5 is a Microsoft standard for software speech synthesizers.
Many speech synthesizers that comply to this standard may be  purchased or downloaded for free from various companies and websites, though it is possible your system may already come with at least one SAPI5 voice preinstalled.
When using this synthesizer with NVDA, the available voices (accessed from the [Voice Settings dialog #VoiceSettings], or by the [Synth Settins Ring #SynthSettingsRing]) will contain all the voices from all the installed SAPI5 engines found on your system.
