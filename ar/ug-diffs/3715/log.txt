  Large reformat of the English User guide to clean up the way key commands are mentioned, to actually mention laptop key commands, and to allow future generation of a key commands document from the user guide. 
  Specific changes:
  *Converted all existing key command lists in to key command tables. Each key command includes a name, a desktop command, a laptop command, and a description.
  *Added a Basic key commands section within the Getting Started section, which just contains a Basic key commands table summarizing stop speech, pause speech, NVDA Menu, keyboard help mode, quit NVDA and report date/time.
  *Split the About NVDA key commands section in the Getting Started section in to subsections.
  *Added a Keyboard Layout subsection to the Getting Started section, which mentions the two layouts, and a note about laptops and numberpads.
  *Removed the Forms and focus mode subsection from the Virtual buffers section as it seems quite redundant.
  *Mention Adobe Flash and Google Chrome as using virtual buffers in the Virtual buffers section.
  *Document formatting settings section: converted the comma-separated list of formatting types in to a proper list. Also included landmarks which wasn't listed previously.
  *Preferences menu section: remove all inline mentions of settings dialog key commands, and instead mention the key command in each respective heading.
  *Moved mention of Move mouse to navigator object and move navigator object to mouse out of the navigating by object section and in to the navigating with the mouse section.
  *Added a Synth Settings Ring section after Voice settings 
  * Added a Review Cursor settings section after the Mouse settings section.
