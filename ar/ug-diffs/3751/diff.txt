 There are currently two ways NVDA is packaged. One is an Installer which will talk you through installing NVDA so that you can then run it at any time from the Start Menu. The other is a self-extracting archive file that contains a fully portable version of NVDA, which you can run from anywhere, including a USB thumb drive or CD.
 
+In order to access the Windows logon screen, User Account Control (UAC) screen or other secure Windows screens, you must install NVDA on your system using the installer.
+These screens cannot be accessed using a portable copy of NVDA.
