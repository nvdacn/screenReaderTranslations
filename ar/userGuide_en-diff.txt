 This structure has nothing to do with how the objects are laid out on the screen, but how they are related logically. This may take a little bit of time to get used to, but once you grasp this, you should be able to move around quite easily.
 
-NVDA currently can not navigate the objects in a screen-based layout due to not having a video intercept driver or display hooks. NVDA chooses not to interact with the screen, more so because over all it should allow a much clearer, and more logical perception of an application and the operating system, rather than trying to picture a flat screen layout.

 Not all applications have a perfect tree structure, but this is up to the developer of that particular application. Most seem to be ok; certainly most Dialog boxes and highly structured applications seem to have gotten it right.

 It is possible to copy parts of the text you are reviewing. For example, you may wish to copy an internet address someone has sent you in a text chat program. To copy text, Start by moving the review cursor to the first character of the text you wish to copy, and press NVDA+f9. Then move to the end of the text, and press NVDA+f10. The text will now be copied to the clipboard so that you can paste it somewhere else. Note that if the program you are using already allows you to move through the text using the system caret, and copy using the normal control+c command, then you will always get better results using this.
 
+++ Flat Review ++
+As well as reviewing the content of a single object, NVDA allows you to review the entire content of a document or the text of the screen.
+This is called flat review.
+
+The following two commands are used for switching to/from flat review:
+- NVDA+numpad7: Switch to flat review at the current position of the review cursor. This allows you to  review the screen (or document if you are currently inside one), with the text review commands.
+- NVDA+numpad1: Switch to object review at the current position of the review cursor. This locates the object that is represented by the text you are currently positioned on in flat review and moves the review cursor to it, so that you are then able to review within that object, or navigate by object away from it.

 ++ Navigating with the Mouse ++

 This dialog box is found in the Preferences menu, under "Document Formatting...". Alternatively, this dialog box can be invoked by pressing NVDA+Control+D. All the checkboxes in this dialog are for configuring what type of formatting you wish to hear automatically as you move the cursor around microsoft word or wordpad documents. For example, if you check the report font name checkbox, each time you arrow onto text with a different font, the name of the font will be announced.

 NVDA's speech dictionaries however are much more powerful than simple word replacement. The Add rule dialog also contains a checkbox to say whether or not you want the rule to be case sensitive (meaning that NVDA should care whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase. NVDA ignores case by default). Another chekbox allows you to state whether your pattern is a "Regular expression". A regular expression is a pattern containing special symbols that allow you to match on more than one character at a time, or match on just numbers, or just letters, as a few examples. Regular expressions are not covered in this user guide, but there are many tutorials on the web which can provide you with more information.
 
-+++ Saving and Reloading the configuration +++
-NVDA stores its settings in a file called nvda.ini in its directory. You will probably never have to touch this file, but for advanced users, this file does allow you to change some extra settings which don't yet have dialog boxes to do so.
+++ Saving and Reloading the configuration ++
 
-NVDA does not automatically save your settings, so if you exit NVDA, and then restart it, the settings will go back to the original values. Note, however, that this default option can be changed under the general options in the preferences menu. To save the settings, you can either choose the Save configuration item in the NVDA menu, or press NVDA+Control+c from anywhere.

 If NVDA is on a read-only file system, such as a CD, it will not be able to save your settings, and it will tell you so.
 
 If you ever make a mistake with your settings and need to revert back to the saved settings, you can either choose the "revert to saved configuration" item in the NVDA menu, or you can press NVDA+Control+r from anywhere.

+Installed versions of NVDA store all settings, custom appModules and custom drivers in a special NVDA directory located in your Windows user profile. 
+This means that each user on the system can have their own NVDA settings.
+To get to your settings directory for an installed version of NVDA, on the start menu you can go to programs -> NVDA -> explore user configuration directory.
