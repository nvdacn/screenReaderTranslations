+Highlights of this release include browse mode for documents in Microsoft Word and Outlook; major enhancements to support for Skype for Desktop; and significant fixes for Microsoft Internet Explorer.
 
 == New Features ==
 - You can now add new symbols in the Symbol Pronunciation dialog. (#4354)
 - In the Input Gestures dialog, you can use the new "Filter by" field to show only gestures containing specific words. (#4458)
 - NVDA now automatically reports new text in mintty. (#4588)
 - In the browse mode Find dialog, there is now an option to perform a case sensitive search. (#4584)
-- Quick navigation (h for heading etc) plus Elements List (NVDA+f7) are now available in Microsoft Word documents by turning on browse mode with NVDA+space. (#2975)
-- Reading HTML messages in Microsoft Outlook 2007 and higher has been majorly improved as Browse mode is automatically enabled for these messages. If browse mode is not enabled in some rare situations, you can force it on with NVDA+space. (#2975) 
-- Table column headers in Microsoft word are automatically reported for tables where a header row has been explicitly specified by the author via Microsoft word's table properties. (#4510) 
- - However, For tables where rows have been merged this will not work automatically. In this situation you can still set column headers manually in NVDA with NVDA+shift+c.

 - In a conversation in Skype for Desktop, NVDA now reports when a contact is typing. (#3506)

-- NVDA will now use the synthesizer/voice's language for character and symbol processing (including punctuation symbol names), regardless of whether automatic language switching is turned on. To turn off this feature so that NVDA again uses its interface language, uncheck the new option in Voice settings called Trust Voice's language when processing characters and symbols. (#4210)

 == Bug Fixes ==
-- In Microsoft Excel, handle the case when row and column header cells are merged. E.g. if A1 and B1 are merged, then B2 will now have A1 and B1 reported as its column header, rather than nothing at all. (#4617)
-- When editing the content of a text box in Microsoft PowerPoint 2003, NVDA will correctly report the content of each line. Previously lines would increasingly be off by one character for each new paragraph. (#4619)
