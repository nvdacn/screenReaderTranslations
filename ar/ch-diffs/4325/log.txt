message:
  Users can now change the pronunciation of punctuation and other symbols, as well as the symbol level at which they are spoken.
  User symbol data should be placed in a file called symbols-locale.dic in the user configuration directory; e.g. symbols-en.dic.
  Data is inherited from the builtin data (just as all locales inherit from English), so only changed info needs to be specified.
