+== Changes ==
+- NVDA is now distributed in one package. Rather than both portable and installer versions, there is now just one file that when run, will start a temporary copy of NVDA, and will allow you to install, or generate a portable distribution.  
+- NVDA is now always installed in to Program Files on all systems. Updating a previous install will also automatically move it if it previously was not installed there.
