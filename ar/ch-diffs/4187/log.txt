message:
  synthDriverHandler: When setting the synth to one which does not yet have any configuration, make sure the config spec is applied when the synth has no voice setting.
  Previously, changeVoice() applied the config spec, but it was only called if there was a voice setting.
  Without a config spec, numeric synth settings were left as strings, causing synth drivers such as audiologic to fail to load.
  Now, changeVoice() is called even for synths that have no voice setting.
  config.updateSynthConfig() has also been removed, as much of its code duplicated changeVoice() anyway.
