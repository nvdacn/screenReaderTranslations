message:
  Fixes for #1367 and #720. Now the tab key is always overridden in browse mode if focus is directly on any kind of non-editable document. This better fixes the issue where tab would take you to the address bar in Internet Explorer when first focused on the document, and also fixes the issue when focus hits the document of an iframe and then tabbing causes you to go to the first focusable in the iframe, rather than the next one after the cursor position.
