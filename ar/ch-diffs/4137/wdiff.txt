== Changes ==
- Position information is no longer reported by default in some cases where}+
 it 
-{from [www.nvda-project.org NVDA_URL].

Go to}-
 
+{was usually incorrect; e.g. most menus,}+
 the 
-{download section and you will find a link to download}-
 
+{Running Applications bar,}+
 the 
-{latest version of NVDA.

There are currently two ways NVDA is packaged.
One is}-
 
+{Notification Area, etc. However, this can be turned on again by}+
 an 
-{Installer which will talk you through installing NVDA so}-
 
+{added option in the Object Presentation settings dialog.
- Keyboard help has been renamed to input help to reflect}+
 that 
-{you can then run}-
 it 
-{at any time}-
 
+{handles input}+
 from 
-{the Start Menu.
The}-
 
+{sources}+
 other 
-{is}-
 
+{than the keyboard.
- Input Help no longer reports}+
 a 
-{self-extracting archive file that contains a fully portable version of NVDA, which you can run from anywhere, including a USB thumb drive or CD.

In order}-
 
+{script's code location via speech and braille as it is cryptic and irrelevant}+
 to 
-{access}-
 the 
-{Windows logon screen, User Account Control (UAC) screen or other secure Windows screens, as well as applications running as administrator in Windows Vista}-
 
+{user. However, it is now logged for developers}+
 and 
-{later, you must install}-
 
+{advanced users.
- When}+
 NVDA 
-{on your system using}-
 
+{detects that it has frozen, it continues to intercept NVDA modifier keys, even though it passes all other keys through to}+
 the 
-{installer.
These screens cannot be accessed using a portable copy of NVDA.

 If 
-{you already have}-
 
+{keys are held down after using}+
 the 
-{NVDA installer, simply press enter or double click on}-
 
+{pass next key through command, all keys (including key repeats) are now passed through until}+
 the 
-{file}-
 
+{last key is released.
- If an NVDA modifier key is pressed twice in quick succession to pass it through}+
 and the 
-{installer}-
 
+{second press is held down, all key repeats}+
 will 
-{start.

As}-
 
+{now be passed through as well.
- The volume up, down and mute keys are now reported in input help. This could be helpful if}+
 the 
-{installer loads, you will hear}-
 
+{user is uncertain as to what these keys are.
- The hotkey for the Review Cursor item in}+
 the NVDA 
-{installation music.
Once loaded,}-

 a 
-{temporary copy}-
 
+{new speech dictionary entry, the title}+
 of 
-{NVDA will allow you to follow}-
 the 
-{prompts}-
 
+{dialog is now "Add dictionary entry" instead}+
 of 
+{"Edit dictionary entry". (#924)
- In speech dictionary dialogs,}+
 the 
-{installer and install NVDA.
Note that if you were running another copy}-
 
+{content}+
 of 
-{NVDA at the time you started the installer,}-
 the 
-{installer will close your previous copy}-
 
+{Regular expression}+
 and 
-{start its own.
This is necessary so that the installer can properly update any changed files.
At this point, if you have another copy}-
 
+{Case sensitive columns}+
 of 
-{NVDA already installed, the NVDA installer will uninstall it for you, and then it will commence to install NVDA.

Once you have successfully completed}-
 the 
-{installation, the installer will alert you that}-

 is 
-{as simple as either pressing control+alt+n, or choosing NVDA from}-

 other 
-{slower medium, it may take a little while to start.
If it is taking an extra long time,}-
 
+{MSHTML controls,}+
 NVDA 
-{should say "Loading NVDA. Please wait..."

If you don't hear any of this, or you hear}-
 
+{now uses}+
 the 
-{Windows error sound, or a descending set of tones, then this means that NVDA has an error, and you will need to possibly report}-
 
+{URL as}+
 a 
-{bug to the developers.
Please check out the NVDA website for how}-
 
+{last resort}+
 to 
-{do this.

When NVDA starts for}-
 
+{determine}+
 the 
-{first time, you will be greeted by}-
 
+{name of}+
 a 
-{dialog box which provides you with some basic information about the}-
 
+{link, rather than presenting empty links. (#633)
-}+
 NVDA 
-{modifier key and}-
 
+{no longer ignores}+
 the 
-{NVDA menu.
(Please see further sections about these topics).
The dialog box also contains two checkboxes.
The first lets you control if NVDA should use}-
 
+{focus  in AOL Instant Messenger 7 menus. (#655)

 the 
-{capslock as an NVDA modifier key, and}-
 
+{correct label for errors in}+

+{(e.g. Not in dictionary, Grammar error, punctuation). Previously  they were all announced as grammar error. (#883)
- Typing in Microsoft Word while using a braille display}+
 should 
-{appear each time NVDA starts.

++ About NVDA keyboard commands ++

+++ The NVDA Modifier Key +++
Most NVDA-specific keyboard commands usually consist of}-
 
+{no longer cause garbled text to be typed, and a rare freeze when}+
 pressing a 
-{particular}-
 
+{braille routing}+
 key 
-{called   the NVDA modifier key,}-
 in 
-{conjunction with one or more other keys.
An exception to this are the}-
 
+{Word documents has been fixed. (#1212) However a limitation is that Arabic}+
 text 
-{review commands which just use the numpad keys by themselves.

NVDA}-
 can 
+{no longer}+
 be 
-{configured so that either}-
 
+{read in Word 2003 and below, while using a braille display. (#627)
- When pressing}+
 the 
-{numpad Insert, Extended Insert, or capslock}-
 
+{delete}+
 key 
-{can}-
 
+{in an edit field, the text/cursor on a braille display should now always}+
 be 
-{used as}-
 
+{updated appropriately to reflect the change. (#947)
- Changes on dynamic pages in Gecko2 documents (E.g. Firefox 4) while multiple tabs are open are now properly reflected by NVDA. Previously only changes in}+
 the 
+{first tab were reflected. (Mozilla bug 610985)
-}+
 NVDA 
-{modifier key.

By default, both}-
 
+{can now properly announce}+
 the 
-{numpad Insert}-
 
+{suggestions for grammar}+
 and 
-{Extended Insert keys}-
 
+{punctuation errors in Microsoft Word spell check dialog. (#704)
- In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, NVDA no longer presents destination anchors as empty links in its virtual buffer. Instead, these anchors}+
 are 
-{set}-
 
+{hidden}+
 as 
+{they should be. (#1326)
- Object navigation around and within standard groupbox windows is no longer broken and asymmetrical.
- In Firefox and other Gecko-based controls,}+
 NVDA 
-{modifier keys.

If you wish to cause one of}-

 NVDA 
-{modifier keys to act like its original key (for instance you wish to turn capslock on}-
  
+{now appropriately announces the next character}+
 when  
-{you have set capslock to be  an NVDA modifier key) you can press}-
 
+{deleting a character with numpadDelete. (#286)
- On}+
 the  
-{key twice in quick succession.

+++ Input Help Mode +++
Many key commands are mentioned through out}-
 
+{Windows XP logon screen,}+
 the 
-{rest of this}-
 user 
-{guide, but an easy way to explore all}-
 
+{name is once again reported when}+
 the 
-{different key commands}-
 
+{selected user}+
 is 
-{to turn on input help.

To turn on input help, press NVDA+1.
To turn it off again, press NVDA+1 again.
While in input help, pressing any key will announce what it does (if}-
 
+{changed.
- Fixed problems when reading text}+
 in 
-{deed it does do something).
The keys will not actually perform their function while in input help mode, so you can press what ever keys you like.

+++ Keyboard Layouts +++
NVDA currently comes}-
 
+{Windows command consoles}+
 with 
-{two sets}-
 
+{reporting}+
 of 
-{key commands.
There is a layout for Desktops and a layout}-
 
+{line numbers enabled.
- The Elements List dialog}+
 for 
-{Laptops.
NVDA by default}-
 
+{virtual buffers}+
 is 
-{set to use the Desktop layout, though you can switch to the Laptop layout in the Keyboard Settings, found under Preferences in the NVDA menu.}-
 
+{now usable by sighted users. All controls are visible on screen. (#1321)
-}+
 The 
-{Desktop layout makes heavy use}-
 
+{list}+
 of 
+{entries in}+
 the 
-{numberpad (with numlock off).
Although most laptops do not have a physical numberpad, some laptops can emulate one}-
 
+{Speech Dictionary dialog is now more readable}+
 by 
-{holding}-
 
+{sighted users. The list is now large enough to show all of its columns on screen. (#90)
- On ALVA BC640/BC680 braille displays, NVDA no longer disregards display keys that are still held}+

+{processing dialog appears. (#1218)
- NVDA now switches}+
 to 
-{turn numlock off,}-
 
+{the appropriate braille display driver when}+
 you

 the 
-{system, the objects are grouped hierarchically.}-
 
+{screen. (#40, #643)

- As Microsoft Excel's formula bar is inaccessible to NVDA, provide an NVDA specific dialog box for editing when the user presses f2 on}+
 a 
-{warning}-
 
+{cell.
- Support for formatting in IAccessible2 text controls, including Mozilla applications.
- Spelling errors can now be reported where possible. This is configurable from the Document Formatting preferences dialog.
- NVDA can be configured to}+
 beep 
-{will}-
 
+{for either all or only visible progress bars. Alternatively, it can}+
 be 
-{heard}-
 
+{configured to speak progress bar values every 10%.
- Links can now be identified in richedit controls.
- The mouse can now be moved to the character under the review cursor in most editable text controls. Previously, the mouse could only be moved to the center of the control.
- In virtual buffers, the review cursor now reviews the text of the buffer, rather than just the internal text of the navigator object (which is often not useful to the user). This means that you can navigate the virtual buffer hierarchically using object navigation and the review cursor will move to that point in the buffer.
- Handle some additional states on Java controls.
- If the title command (NVDA+t) is pressed twice, it spells the title. If pressed thrice, it is copied to the clipboard.
- Keyboard help now reads the names of modifier keys when pressed alone.
- Key names announced by keyboard help are now translatable.
- Added support for the recognized text field in SiRecognizer. (#198)
- Support for braille displays!
- Added a command (NVDA+c) to report the text on the Windows clipboard. (#193)
- In virtualBuffers,}+
 if 
+{NVDA automatically switches to focus mode, you can use the escape key to switch back to browse mode. NVDA+space can still also be used.
- In virtual buffers, when the focus changes or the caret is moved, NVDA can automatically switch to focus mode or browse mode as appropriate for the control under the caret. This is configured from the Virtual Buffers dialog. (#157)
- Rewritten SAPI4 synthesizer driver which replaces the sapi4serotek and sapi4activeVoice drivers and should fix the problems encountered with these drivers.
- The NVDA application now includes a manifest, which means that it no longer runs in compatibility mode in Windows Vista.
- The configuration file and speech dictionaries are now saved in the user's application data directory if NVDA was installed using the installer. This is necessary for Windows Vista and also allows multiple users to have individual NVDA configurations.
- Added support for position information for IAccessible2 controls.
- Added the ability to copy text to the clipboard using the review cursor. NVDA+f9 sets the start marker to the current position of the review cursor. NVDA+f10 retrieves the text between the start marker and the current position of the review cursor and copies it to the clipboard. (#240)
- Added support for some edit controls in pinacle tv software.
- When announcing selected text for long selections (512 characters or more), NVDA now speaks the number of selected characters, rather than speaking the entire selection. (#249)


== Changes ==
- If the audio output device is set to use the Windows default device (Microsoft Sound Mapper), NVDA will now switch to the new default device for eSpeak and tones when the default device changes. For example, NVDA will switch to a USB audio device if it automatically becomes the default device when it is connected.
- Improve performance of eSpeak with some Windows Vista audio drivers.
- reporting of links, headings, tables, lists and block quotes can now be configured from the Document Formatting settings dialog. Previously to configure these settings for virtual buffers, the virtual buffer settings dialog would have been used. Now all documents share this configuration.
- Rate is now the default setting in the speech synthesizer settings ring.
- Improve the loading and unloading of appModules.
- The title command (NVDA+t) now only reports the title instead of the entire object. If the foreground object has no name, the application's process name is used.
- Instead of virtual buffer pass through on and off, NVDA now reports focus mode (pass through on) and browse mode (pass through off).
- Voices are now stored in the configuration file by ID instead of by index. This makes voice settings more reliable across systems and configuration changes. The voice setting will not be preserved in old configurations and an error may be logged the first time a synthesizer is used. (#19)
- The level of a tree view item is now announced first if it has changed from the previously focused item for all tree views. Previously, this was only occurring for native Windows (SysTreeView32) tree views.


== Bug Fixes ==
- The last chunk of audio is no longer cut off when using NVDA with eSpeak on a remote desktop server.
- Fix problems with saving speech dictionaries for certain voices.
- Eliminate the lag when moving by units other than character (word, line, etc.) towards the bottom of large plain text documents in Mozilla Gecko virtual buffers. (#155)
- If speak typed words is enabled, announce the word when enter is pressed.
- Fix some character set issues in richedit documents.
- The NVDA log viewer now uses richedit instead of just edit to display the log. This improves reading by word with NVDA.
- Fix some issues related to embedded objects in richedit controls.
- NVDA now reads page numbers in Microsoft Word. (#120)
- Fix the issue where tabbing to a checked checkbox in a Mozilla Gecko virtual buffer and pressing space would not announce that the checkbox was being unchecked.
- Correctly report partially checked checkboxes in Mozilla applications.
- If the text selection expands or shrinks in both directions, read the selection as one chunk instead of two.
- When reading with the mouse, text in Mozilla Gecko edit fields should now be read.
- Say all should no longer cause certain SAPI5 synthesizers to crash.
- Fixed an issue which meant that text selection changes were not being read in Windows standard edit controls before the first focus change after NVDA was started.
- Fix mouse tracking in Java objects. (#185)
- NVDA no longer reports Java tree view items with no children as being collapsed.
- Announce the object with focus when a Java window comes to the foreground. Previously, only the top-level Java object was announced.
- The eSpeak synthesizer driver no longer stops speaking completely after a single error.
- Fix the issue whereby updated voice parameters (rate, pitch, etc.) were not saved when the voice was changed from the synthesizer settings ring.
- Improved the speaking of typed characters and words.
- Some new text that was previously not spoken in text console applications (such as some text adventure games) is now spoken.
- NVDA now ignores focus changes in background windows. Previously, a background focus change could be treated as if the real focus changed.
- Improved the detection of the focus when leaving context menus. Previously, NVDA often didn't react at all when leaving a context menu.
- NVDA now announces when the context menu is activated in the Start menu.
- The classic Start menu is now announced as Start menu instead of Application menu.
- Improved the reading of alerts such as those encountered in Mozilla Firefox. The text should no longer be read multiple times and other extraneous information will no longer be read. (#248)
- The text of focusable, read-only edit fields will no longer be included when retrieving the text of dialogs. This fixes, for example, the automatic reading of the entire license agreement in installers.
- NVDA no longer announces the unselection of text when leaving some edit controls (example: Internet Explorer address bar, Thunderbird 3 email address fields).
- When opening plain text emails in Outlook Express and Windows Mail, focus is correctly placed in the message ready for the user to read it. Previously the user had to press tab or click on the message in order to use cursor keys to read it.
- Fixed several major issues with the "Speak command keys" functionality.
- NVDA can now read text past 65535 characters in standard edit controls (e.g. a large file in Notepad).
- Improved line reading in MSHTML edit fields (Outlook Express editable messages and Internet Explorer text input fields).
- NVDA no longer sometimes freezes completely when editing text in OpenOffice. (#148, #180)

+{read}+
 a 
-{floating window is available that allows you to  view all the}-
 
+{specific bit of}+
 text 
-{that NVDA is currently speaking.

To enable the speech viewer, check}-
 
+{with}+
 the 
-{"Speech Viewer" menu item under Tools}-
 
+{mouse.
- Added a new config option, found}+
 in the 
-{NVDA menu.
Uncheck}-
 
+{mouse settings dialog. Play audio when mouse moves, when checked, plays a 40 ms beep each time}+
 the 
-{menu item}-
 
+{mouse moves, with its pitch (between 220 and 1760 hz) representing the y axis, and left/right volume, representing the x axis. This enables a blind person}+
 to 
-{disable it.

While}-
 
+{get a rough idea of where}+
 the 
-{speech viewer}-
 
+{mouse}+
 is 
-{enabled, it constantly updates to show you}-
 
+{on}+
 the 
-{most current text}-
 
+{screen as its}+
 being 
-{spoken.
However,}-
 
+{moved. This feature also depends on reportObjectUnderMouse also being turned on. So this means that}+
 if you 
-{click}-
 
+{quickly need to disable both beeps and announcing of objects, then just press NVDA+m. The beeps are also louder}+
 or 
-{focus inside the viewer, NVDA will temporarily stop updating}-
 
+{softer depending on how bright}+
 the 
-{text, so}-
 
+{screen is at}+
 that 
+{point.


== Object presentation and interaction ==
- Improved support for most common treeview controls. NVDA now tells}+
 you 
+{how many items}+
 are 
-{able to easily select or copy}-
 
+{in}+
 the 
-{existing content.

++ Python Console ++
The NVDA Python console, found under  Tools}-
 
+{branch when you expand it. It also announces the level when moving}+
 in 
+{and out of branches. And, it announces the current item number and number of items, according to}+
 the 
-{NVDA menu, is a development tool which}-
 
+{current branch, not the entire treeview.
- Improved what}+
 is 
-{useful for debugging, general inspection of NVDA internals}-
 
+{announced when focus changes as you move around applications}+
 or 
-{inspection of}-
 the 
-{accessibility hierarchy}-
 
+{operating system. Now instead}+
 of

Each voice that comes with eSpeak speaks}-
 a 
-{different language.
There are over 20 different languages supported by eSpeak.

There are}-
 
+{button inside a groupbox, the groupbox will}+
 also

+{speak}+
 the 
-{sound}-
 
+{message inside many dialog boxes as they appear. This is accurate most}+
 of the 
-{voice.

++ Microsoft Speech API version 4 (SAPI 4) ++
SAPI 4 is an older Microsoft standard for software speech synthesizers.
Many speech synthesizers}-
 
+{time, though there are still many dialogs}+
 that 
-{comply with this standard may be  purchased or downloaded for free from various companies and websites.
When using this synthesizer with NVDA, the available voices (accessed from the [Voice Settings dialog #VoiceSettings] or by the [Synth Settins Ring #SynthSettingsRing]) will contain all the voices from all}-
 
+{arn't as good as they could be.
- Added a report object descriptions checkbox to}+
 the 
-{installed SAPI 4 engines found}-
 
+{object presentation settings dialog. Power users may wish to sometimes uncheck this to stop NVDA announcing a lot of extra descriptions}+
 on 
-{your system.

If you have SAPI 4 voices installed but the synthesizer does not appear}-
 
+{particular controls,  such as}+
 in 
-{NVDA's list of synthesizers, please install}-
 
+{Java applications.
- NVDA automatically announces selected text in edit controls when focus moves to them. If there isn't any selected text, then it just announces}+
 the 
-{SAPI 4.0 runtime binaries, available at http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/sapi/spchapi.exe.

++ Microsoft Speech API version 5 (SAPI 5) ++
SAPI 5}-
 
+{current line like usual.
- NVDA}+
 is a 
-{Microsoft standard for software speech synthesizers.
Many speech synthesizers that comply with this standard may be  purchased or downloaded for free from various companies}-
 
+{lot more careful now when it plays beeps to indicate progress bar changes in applications. It no longer goes crazy in Eclipse applications such as Lotus Notes/Symphony,}+
 and 
-{websites, though your system will probably already come with at least one SAPI 5 voice preinstalled.
When using this synthesizer with NVDA, the available voices (accessed from}-
 
+{Accessibility Probe.

-{more entries.

Each section provides mappings for scripts}-
 
+{NVDA would entirely crash, when}+
 in a 
+{Dos console window.
- If support for a}+
 particular 
-{Python module}-
 
+{language exists, NVDA now automatically can show its interface}+
 and 
-{class inside NVDA.}-
 
+{speak its messages in the language Windows is set to. A particular language can still be chosen manualy from the user interface settings dialog as well.}+

- 
-{The section name}-
 
+{Added script 'toggleReportDynamicContentChanges' (insert+5). This toggles whether new text, or other dynamic changes}+
 should be 
-{the Python module and class separated by a dot (.).}-
 
+{automatically announced. So far this only works in Dos Console Windows.}+

- 
-{The key of each entry is the name of the}-
 
+{Added}+
 script 
-{to which input gestures}-
 
+{'toggleCaretMovesReviewCursor' (insert+6). This toggles whether the review cursor}+
 should be 
-{bound.
Alternatively, you can use None}-
 
+{automatically repositioned when the system caret moves. This is useful in Dos console windows when trying}+
 to 
-{unbind input gestures from a}-
 
+{read information as the screen is updating.
- Added}+
 script 
-{to which they were previously bound.}-
 
+{'toggleFocusMovesNavigatorObject' (insert+7). This toggles whether the navigator object is repositioned on the object with focus as it changes.}+

- 
-{The entry value}-
 
+{Added some documentation translated in to various languages. So far there}+
 is 
-{a comma (,) separated list}-
 
+{French, Spannish and Finish.
- Removed some developer documentation from the binary distribution}+
 of 
-{gesture identifiers for}-
 
+{NVDA, it is only now in}+
 the 
-{input gestures that should be bound.}-
 
+{source version.}+

-


-{Gesture identifiers consist of}-
 
+{Fixed}+
 a 
-{two leter device code (kb for keyboard and br for braille display), an optional sub-device or keyboard layout}-
 
+{possible bug}+
 in 
-{brackets, a colon,}-
 
+{Windows Live Messanger}+
 and 
-{then one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.

In order to discover gesture identifiers, script names}-
 
+{MSN Messenger where arrowing up}+
 and 
+{down}+
 the 
-{class and module in which they}-
 
+{contact list would cause errors.
- New messages}+
 are 
-{contained, you can:
+ Turn on Input Help.
+ Activate the gesture (press the key).
+ Turn off input help.
+ Activate View log}-
 
+{now automatically spoken when}+
 in 
+{a conversation using Windows Live Messenger. (only works for English versions so far)
- The history window in a Windows Live Messenger conversation can now be read by using}+
 the 
-{NVDA Tools menu.
+ Examine the recent log entries.
One of these should provide information about the input gesture you sent, including the module.class and}-
 
+{arrow keys. (Only works for English versions so far) 
- Added}+
 script 
-{if it is bound}-
 
+{'passNextKeyThrough' (insert+f2). Press this key, and then the next key pressed will be passed straight through}+
 to 
-{one.
+

Following}-
 
+{Windows. This}+
 is 
-{an example of how}-
 
+{useful if}+
 you 
-{could bind NVDA+shift+t}-
 
+{have}+
 to 
-{the date time script.

To find out the correct script name and module.class for date time, you would turn on Input Help and}-
 press 
-{NVDA+f12 (as this is the current gesture}-
 
+{a certain key in an application but NVDA uses that key}+
 for 
-{the date time script).
You would then turn off Input Help}-
 
+{something else.
- NVDA no longer freezes up for more than a minute when opening very large documents in MS Word.
- Fixed a bug where moving out of a table in MS Word,}+
 and 
-{examine}-
 
+{then moving back in, caused}+
 the 
-{log viewer.

Towards}-
 
+{current row/column numbers not to be spoken if moving back in to exactly}+
 the 
-{bottom, you would see:

```
INFO}-
 
+{same cell.}+

- 
-{inputCore.InputManager._handleInputHelp (13:17:22):
Input help: gesture kb(desktop):nvda+f12, bound to script dateTime on globalCommands.GlobalCommands
```

From this, you can see}-
 
+{When starting NVDA with a synthesizer}+
 that 
-{the script name}-
 
+{doesn't exist, or}+
 is 
-{dateTime}-
 
+{not working, the sapi5 synth will try and be loaded in stead, or if sapi5 isn't working, then speech will be set to silence.
- Increasing}+
 and 
+{decreasing rate scripts can no longer take}+
 the 
-{module.class is globalCommands.GlobalCommands.}-
 
+{rate above 100 or below 0.
-}+
 If 
-{the file does not yet exist, you would create}-
 
+{there is an error with}+
 a 
-{text file called gestures.ini}-
 
+{language when choosing it}+
 in the 
+{User Interface Settings dialog, a message box will alert the}+
 user 
+{to the fact.
- NVDA now asks if it should save}+
 configuration 
-{directory}-
 and 
-{add the following content:

```
[globalCommands.GlobalCommands]
	dateTime = kb:NVDA+shift+t
```

This would bind}-
 
+{restart if}+
 the 
-{key press NVDA+shift+t (in any keyboard layout) to}-
 
+{user has just changed}+
 the 
-{dateTime script.

Note that}-
 
+{language in}+
 the 
-{original NVDA+f12 binding would still work.
If you wanted to remove this binding, you would add}-
 
+{User Interface Settings Dialog. NVDA must be restarted for}+
 the 
-{following line:

```
	None = kb:NVDA+f12
```

Although you are free to have scripts bound}-
 
+{language change}+
 to 
-{any available key, it may}-
 
+{fully take effect.
- If a synthesizer can not}+
 be 
-{problematic to use}-
 
+{loaded, when choosing it from}+
 the 
-{alt key on}-
 
+{synthesizer dialog, a message box alerts}+
 the 
-{keyboard.
NVDA still sends modifier keys (such as shift, control and alt)}-
 
+{user}+
 to the 
-{Operating System, even if they eventuate in a script.
Thus, if you do use alt in}-
 
+{fact.
- When loading}+
 a 
-{gesture, pressing this key combination may activate the menu bar, as well as executing the script.
Therefore, it is probably best to just use Shift, control and}-
 
+{synthesizer for}+
 the 
+{first time,}+
 NVDA 
-{modifier key as modifiers.
