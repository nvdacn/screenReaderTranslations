message:
  Reverted last commit to do with supporting 64 bit Mozilla Gecko as this has now been found to clealry be a bug in Gecko which  could easily be fixed with a change to one line of Gecko code. and since 64 bit builds are still not official, Gecko still has a chance t o fix before the public at large get their hands on it.
