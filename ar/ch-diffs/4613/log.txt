message:
  The Read active window script (NVDA+b for Desktops) has been improved so that it now filters out unuseful controls and is much easier to silence. The new code is heavily based on sayAllhandler's readText functionality, but  rather than moving a TextInfo it recurses through an object's subtree using its simpleFirstchild and simpleNext properties. As its using sayAll functionality, it does not overload the synth with speech. It currently also moves the navigator object to each object.
