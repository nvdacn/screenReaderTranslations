message:
  nvdaHelper remote: injection_winEventCallback: If the process is exiting, just return immediately, as doing anything will probably cause a crash.
  At this point, the CRT could be terminated, data structures could be in an undefined state due to ExitProcess terminating our manager thread, etc.
  To do this, we set a flag in DllMain when it informs us that the process is terminating.
  Fixes crashes when exiting Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware in Windows XP.
