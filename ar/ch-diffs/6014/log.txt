message:
  IAccessibleHandler.accFocus: Don't call accChild for CHILDID_SELF.
  Some implementations do return CHILDID_SELF and we end up in an endless loop when this happens because the objeccts appear different each time, even though we're actually getting different pointers to the same accessible.
  This fix means that NVDA no longer freezes when using Asian character input in some .NET applications.
