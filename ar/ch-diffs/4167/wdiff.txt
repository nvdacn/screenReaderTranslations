== New Features ==
- It is now possible to hear the description for any given character by pressing the review current character script twice in quick succession.  For English characters this is the standard English phonetic alphabet. For pictagraphic languages such as traditional Chinese, one or more example phraises using the given symbol are provided. Also pressing review current word or review current line three times will spell the word/line using the first of these descriptions.
- More text can be seen in flat review for applications such as Mozilla Thunderbird  who write their text directly to the display as glyphs.

+{- It is now possible to choose from several levels of punctuation and symbol announcement. (#332)
- When punctuation or other symbols are repeated more than four times, the number of repetitions is now announced instead of speaking the repeated symbols. (#43)}+
