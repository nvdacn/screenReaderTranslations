message:
  gui: Code cleanup:
  	* Remove our custom external execute event code (including gui.execute) and instead just use wx.CallAfter.
  	* Remove scriptUI. The code is very old and was designed for the time when the GUI ran in a separate thread. Also, we use custom dialogs in many places already anyway.
  	* Add gui.runScriptModalDialog to simplify using modal dialogs from scripts.
