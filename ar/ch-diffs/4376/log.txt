message:
  Don't allow NVDA settings dialogs to be shown while a message dialog is being shown.
  Previously, you could open the settings dialog, but it would be frozen until the message dialog was dismissed, which was impossible in some configurations.
  To do this (and to clean up the code somewhat), introduce gui.messageBox, which should be used for all message dialogs.
  Also removed gui.scriptUI.MessageDialog, as it was only used in a couple of places and the eventual aim is to get rid of (or at least majorly refactor) scriptUI.
