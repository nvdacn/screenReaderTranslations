message:
  Added feature to beep when typing lowercase characters while capslock is on. Code mostly taken from patch in ticket 663 with the following changes:
  	* config option name renamed from beepLowercaseLetters to beepForLowercaseWithCapslock.
  	* All code to do with checking if it should beep, and actually beeping, is now all in event_typedCharacters rather than some of it being in a function in speech -- its not really speech related code.
  	* Changed the type of the beep from 2000 hz 50 ms to 3000 hz 40 ms (to slightly distinguish it from the beep for uppercase letters).
  	* Only check the lower order bit on capslock's key state as this is the toggle bit. The patch was also checking  the high order bit (-127) but this is only indicating if its currently pressed.
