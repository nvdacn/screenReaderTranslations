message:
  config: When executing a process with elevation, ensure that parameters containing spaces are quoted.
  In particular, this is necessary for setSystemConfigToCurrentConfig, as the config path might contain spaces.
  Fixes inability to set system config to current config when the username contains a space.
  Note that execElevated() now takes params as a list.
