message:
  Announce the way an item is sorted (if any) according to its aria-sort property, on both individual NVDAObjects, and in virtualBuffers, for both MSHTML and gecko ia2. NVDA will report "sorted ascending", "sorted descending" or just "sorted" depending on what kind of sort it is. Announcement as it changes is not supported yet and may need bug fixes in some web browsers.
