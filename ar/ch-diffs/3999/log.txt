message:
  Allow braille display drivers to bind buttons, wheels and other controls to scripts in NVDA using the new input framework.
  Braille display drivers should now provide all input as a braille.BrailleDisplayGesture instance.
  They can provide a global input gesture map to add bindings for scripts anywhere in NVDA.
  They can also provide their own scripts to perform display specific functions.
  See braille.BrailleDisplayDriver for details.
  Note that the handyTech and lilli modules have not yet been updated, though they will still work as they did previously.
