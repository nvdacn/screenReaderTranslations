message:
  adobeAcrobat.Document NVDAObject: When moving the focus, Acrobat sometimes fires focus on the document before firing it on the real focus. Therefore, if already focused inside this document, only allow focus on the document if it has no active descendant.
  Fixes extraneous announcement of document info when moving to a control on a different page in focus mode.
