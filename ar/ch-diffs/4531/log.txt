message:
  Do not ever use UI Automation for the SysMonthCal32 calendar control as its UI Automation implementation is very broken. This not only fixes #1637 but also provides the same support for this control in Windows 7 as was found in Windows Vista (i.e. pressing the arrow keys and changing the date has NVDA announce the new date).
