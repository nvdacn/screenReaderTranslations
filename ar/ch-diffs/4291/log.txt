message:
  virtual buffers: Allow pass through to be enabled on objects with the focused state but without the focusable state.
  This is because objects that are focused using aria-descendant don't get the focusable state, since they aren't normally focusable.
  In particular, this fixes dropping out of focus mode when the completion list appears for some auto complete controls.
