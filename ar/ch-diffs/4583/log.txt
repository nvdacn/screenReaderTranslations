message:
  KeyboardInputGesture.send: Pass the scan code to keybd_event if we have it.
  It seems that Windows consoles treat the backspace and arrow keys differently if the scan code is not provided. In the case of received keys, we already have the scan code, so it's easy to provide it.
  Fixes weirdness with the backspace and arrow keys in Windows consoles.
