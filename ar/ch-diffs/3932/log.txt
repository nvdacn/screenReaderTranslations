message:
  Support for automatically reporting new text when it appears on the screen!
  To avoid lag and spam, this must be enabled for individual controls using the LiveText and Terminal NVDAObject behaviors and the DisplayModelLiveText overlay class.
  Specific support for mIRC, PuTTY, Tera Term Pro and SecureCRT has been included so far.
  See those app modules for examples on how to do this for other applications.
  Windows text consoles now use this new LiveText/Terminal behavior, which means they use the same monitoring code. This code is similar to the previous code in winConsoleHandler, but has been simplified and improved somewhat.
