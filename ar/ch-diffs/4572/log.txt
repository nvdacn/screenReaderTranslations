  MSHTML vbufBackend: Fix for #1685. HTML elements with a display style of None no longer cause line breaks in browse mode. We do add these elements to the buffer, but never  give them any content. This is so we can still get events where the display style changes to not None. But previously these nodes  were set as block nodes. Now they are not -- thus now being completely hidden, even from line calculation.
