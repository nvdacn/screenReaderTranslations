message:
  Review current word/line scripts when pressed three times: now only the first description for each character is announced, as announcing all of them is simply just not practical. Review current character pressed twice still announces all descriptions for a given character. Specifically, speech._speakSpellingGen now joins the character descriptions, and or just uses the first one. Previously characterProcessing.getCharacterDescription used to join them.
