  More fixes for laptop layout (Really fixes #800):
  *Moved move mouse to navigator object script in laptop layout from NVDA+shift+leftArrow to NVDA+shift+f9
  *Moved set NavigatorObject to mouse script in laptop layout from NVDA+shift+rightArrow to NVDA+shift+f10
  *Added toggleLeftMouseButton and toggleRightMouseButton scripts to laptop layout, mapping them to NVDA+shift+leftArrow and NVDA+shift+rightArrow respectivly. 
   Note that it was important for the toggle mouse button scripts to be on the arrows as the mouse click scripts are on the arrows, thus the mouse navigator object routing scripts had to be moved.
