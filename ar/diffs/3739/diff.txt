 Usually this configuration should not be touched.
 To change how NVDA is configured on the logon/UAC screens, configure NVDA to how you wish  while logged in to Windows, and then instruct NVDA to copy the configuration to the logon screen by using the button in the General settings dialog.
    
++ Advanced Tools for developers +
+   ++ Log Viewer ++
+The log viewer, found under Tools in the NVDA menu, allows you to view all the logging output that has occured up until now from when you last started NVDA.
+
+Apart from reading the content, you can also Save a copy of the log file, or refresh the viewer so that it shows the most recent output since the Log viewer was opened. These actions are available under the viewer's Log menu.
+
+++ Speech Viewer ++
+For sighted software developers or people demoing NVDA to sighted audiences, a floating window is available that allows you to  view all the text that NVDA is currently speaking.
+
+To enable the speech viewer, check  the "Speech Viewer" menu item under Tools in the NVDA menu. Uncheck the menu item to disable it.
+
+While the speech viewer is enabled, it constantly updates to show you the most current text being spoken. However, if you click or focus inside the viewer, NVDA will temporarily stop updating the text, so that you are able to easily select or copy the existing content.
+
+++ Python Console ++
+The NVDA Python console emulates an  interactive Python interpreter from within NVDA. It is a development tool which is useful for debugging, general inspection of NVDA internals or inspection of the accessibility hierarchy of an application. 
+
+=== Usage ===
+The console can be activated in two ways: 
+- By pressing NVDA+control+z. If activated in this fashion, a snapshot of the current state of NVDA at the time the key was pressed will be taken and saved in certain variables available in the console. See Snapshot Variables for more details. 
+- By selecting Tools -> Python console from the NVDA system tray menu. 
+-
+
+The console is similar to the standard interactive Python interpreter. Input is accepted one line at a time. The current line is processed when enter is pressed. You can navigate through the history of previously entered lines using the up and down arrow keys. 
+Output (responses from the interpreter) will be spoken when enter is pressed. The f6 key toggles between the input and output controls. 
+Closing the console window simply hides it. This allows the user to return to the session as it was left when it was closed, including history and variables. 
+
+=== Namespace ===
+==== Automatic Imports ====
+For convenience, the following modules and variables are automatically imported in the console: sys, os, wx, log (from logHandler), api, queueHandler, speech, braille 
+
+==== Snapshot Variables ====
+Whenever NVDA+control+z is pressed, certain variables available in the console will be assigned according to the current state of NVDA. These variables are: 
+- focus: The current focus object 
+- focusAnc: The ancestors of the current focus object 
+- fdl: Focus difference level; i.e. the level at which the ancestors for the current and previous focus differ 
+- fg: The current foreground object 
+- nav: The current navigator object 
+- review: The TextInfo instance representing the current position of the review cursor
+- mouse: The current mouse object 
+- brlRegions: The braille regions from the active braille buffer
