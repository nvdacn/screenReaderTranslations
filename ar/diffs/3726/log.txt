message:
  Fixes for  laptop key commands (Fixes #800):
  *Changed review_sayAll in laptop layout from NVDA+/ to NVDA+shift+downArrow, as / is not a specific key on particular non-English keyboards (such as German).
  *NavigatorObject_toFocus script now moves the review cursor to the caret if one exists inside that object, else it just places it at the beginning of the object.
  *Removed review_moveToCaret as navigatorObject_toFocus can now be used instead.
   *Remapped navigatorObject_toFocus in laptop layout from NVDA+control+back to NVDA+back (as review_moveToCaret is now gone). It also coensides much better with its desktop counterpart (NVDA+subtract).
  *Mapped navigatorObject_moveFocus to NVDA+shift+back in the laptop layout.
  *Mapped navigatorObject_moveCaretHere to NVDA+control+back in the laptop layout.
  *Mentioned review_moveCaretHere script in the English User Guide.
