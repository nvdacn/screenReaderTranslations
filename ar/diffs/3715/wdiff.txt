When NVDA starts for the first time, you will be greeted by a dialog box which provides you with some basic information about the NVDA modifier key and the NVDA menu. (Please see further sections about these topics). The dialog box also contains two checkboxes. The first lets you control if NVDA should use the capslock as an NVDA modifier key, and the second lets you control if this Welcome dialog should appear each time NVDA starts.

++ About NVDA keyboard commands ++

+{+++ The NVDA Modifier Key +++}+
 
Most NVDA-specific keyboard commands usually consist of pressing the NVDA modifier key, in conjunction with one or more other keys. An exception to this are the text review commands which just use the numpad keys by themselves.

By default both numpad insert and extended insert can be used as the NVDA modifier key. However, you can also configure NVDA so that the capslock key also becomes an NVDA modifier key. When configured this way, pressing or holding down capslock acts as an NVDA modifier key, but pressing it twice in quick succession causes it to act as the normal capslock key.


+{+++ Keyboard Help Mode +++}+

Many key commands are mentioned through out the rest of this user guide, but an easy way to explore all the different key commands is to turn on keyboard help.

To turn on keyboard help, press NVDA+1. To turn it off again, press NVDA+1 again. While in keyboard help, pressing any key will announce what it does (if in deed it does do something). The keys will not actually perform their function while in keyboard help mode, so you can press what ever keys you like.


+{+++ Keyboard Layouts +++

NVDA currently comes with two sets of key commands. There is a layout for Desktops and a layout for Laptops.
NVDA by default is set to use the Desktop layout, though you can switch to the Laptop layout in the Keyboard Settings, found under Preferences in the NVDA menu.

The Desktop layout makes heavy use of the numberpad (with numlock off).
Although most laptops do not have a physical numberpad, some laptops can emulate one by holding down the FN key and pressing letters and numbers on the right-hand side of the keyboard (7 8 9 u i o j k l etc).
If your laptop can not do this, or does not allow you to turn numlock off, you may want to switch to the Laptop layout instead.}+


++ The NVDA menu ++
The NVDA menu allows you to control NVDA's settings, access help, save/revert your configuration, Modify speech dictionaries, read the log file, and exit NVDA.

To get to the NVDA menu from anywhere in Windows while NVDA is running, press NVDA+n. You can also get to the NVDA menu via the windows system tray. Either right-click on the nvda icon located in the system tray, or access the system tray by pressing the windows logo key+B, DownArrow to the NVDA icon and press the applications key located next to the right control key on most keyboards. When the menu comes up, You can use the arrow keys to navigate the menu, and the enter key to activate an item. The Preferences menu allows you to configure NVDA how you like, the tools menu contains useful tools such as the NVDA log viewer and the NVDA Python console for developers, the help menu allows you to access the user guide, a quick key reference, and much more. The NVDA menu also contains items that allow you to save or revert your current configuration. There is also an option that allows you to exit NVDA, although this can be accomplished more efficiently by pressing NVDA+Q.

+ Navigating with NVDA +


++ Navigating with the 
+{System}+
 Focus ++
The Most common way of navigating around Windows with NVDA, is to just move around with normal keyboard commands, such as tab and shift tab to move forward and back between controls, pressing alt to get to the menu bar and then using the arrows to navigate menus, using alt+tab to move between running applications. As you do this, NVDA will announce what has focus.


When NVDA announces an object (e.g. when it receives 
+{the System}+
 focus), it will usually say the object's name, type, state, value, description, keyboard shortcut, and positional information. This is quite similar to other screen readers; however the types of objects may be a little different.






There are some key commands that are useful when moving with 
+{the System}+
 focus:

++ Navigating with the System Caret ++
When the focus is on an object that has an edit cursor (system caret), you can arrow around and edit like you normally would. NVDA will announce as you move by character, word, line, and will also announce selecting and unselecting text.

+ Virtual Buffers +
Complex read-only documents, such as web pages, are represented in NVDA with in a Virtual Buffer.

A virtual buffer is a flat representation of content such as a web page, that can be moved around in with the arrow keys. Information such as whether text is a link, heading etc is announced along with the text as you move.


While in a virtual buffer, there are two modes of interaction. 
Browse mode is where you can move around all the text using a virtual cursor, rather like the system caret. In fact all of NVDA's system caret key commands will work in this mode (e.g. say all, report formatting, all table navigation commands etc). 
Focus mode is where you can directly interact with the control (edit field, combo box, radio buttons) using what ever keys you would normally use. 
When in Browse mode, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it. Note that pressing enter or space on controls that require it will also switch to focus mode.
