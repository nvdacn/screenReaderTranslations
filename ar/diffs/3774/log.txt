message:
  Rename the Follow Text insertion point option found in the Review Cursor dialog to Follow System Caret. Previously I thought that text insertion point may have been easier to understand, however we do not mention it anywhere else in NVDA or the user guide, yet we do mention System Caret quite a lot.
