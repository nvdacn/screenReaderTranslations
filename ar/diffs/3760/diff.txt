 Most NVDA-specific keyboard commands usually consist of pressing  a particular  key called   the NVDA modifier key, in conjunction with one or more other keys. An exception to this are the text review commands which just use the numpad keys by themselves.
 
 NVDA can be configured so that either the numpad Insert, Extended Insert, or capslock key can be used as the NVDA modifier key.
