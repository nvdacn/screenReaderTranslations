  English user guide changes:
  *Move information about each supported synthesizer in to a Supported Speech Synthesizers section just before Supported Braille Displays.
  *Majorly rewrite information about each speech synthesizer. Note: could someone *please* contribute some information about the AudioLogic and NewFon synthesizers, thanks.
  *Synthesizer dialog section: rearrange so that the Synthesizer option is its own subsection, and add a subsection for the Output Device option.
