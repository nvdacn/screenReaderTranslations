 Apart from providing its messages and interface in several languages, NVDA can also enable the user to read content in any language, as long as they have a speech synthesizer that can speak that language.
 
 NVDA is bundled with [eSpeak http://espeak.sourceforge.net/], a free, open-source, multi-lingual speech synthesizer.
-Additionally, NVDA can use both SAPI4 and SAPI5 speech engines to provide speech output, as well as the Audiologic and NewFon speech synthesizers.

 +++ Synthesizer Selection (NVDA+control+s) +++
 The Synthesizer dialog, which is found under "Synthesizer..." in the Preferences menu, allows you to select which Synthesizer NVDA should use to speak with.
+Once you have selected your synthesizer of choice, you can press Ok and NVDA will load the selected Synthesizer.
+If there is an error loading the synthesizer, NVDA will notify you with a message, and continue using the previous synthesizer.
 
-The dialog contains a simple combo box, which lists all the available synthesizers.
-Choose the synthesizer you want using the arrow keys, and then press ok.
-If there is an error loading the synthesizer, a message box will alert you, and NVDA will keep the old synthesizer loaded.
-
-The current list of synthesizers NVDA supports is: eSpeak, SAPI4, SAPI5, Audiologic, and Silence.
-
-The eSpeak synthesizer is built directly in to NVDA, and does not depend on any other special drivers or SAPI runtime to be installed.
-NVDA starts using eSpeak by default.
-This synthesizer should work on any system that NVDA works on, so it will definitely work when running NVDA off a USB thumb drive or CD, on anyone else's system.
+==== Synthesizer ====
+This option allows you to choose the synthesizer you wish NVDA to use for speech output.
 
-The Sapi4 option allows you to use the Sapi synthesizer.
-Voices that are included under Ssapi4 include eloquence voices, as well as other Ssapi4 voices that you may have installed on your system.
+For a list of the Synthesizers that NVDA supports, please see the [Supported Speech Synthesizers #SupportedSpeechSynths] section.
 
-The Sapi5 synthesizer allows you to use the microsoft voices that are iincluded on your machine.
-In XP, the default Ssapi5 voice is Microsoft Sam.
-In Vista, the default voice is Microsoft Anna.
-Depending on what voices you have installed, others may show up under Ssapi5.
-
-The Silence synthesizer driver is not that useful, unless you want to not have any speech at all while running NVDA.
-
-Please note that no matter how many different SAPI4 or SAPI5 voices (or engines) you have installed on your system, only the actual SAPI4 and SAPI5 synthesizers will show up in the Synthesizers dialog. To actually select one of the engines (voices), select either SAPI4 or SAPI5, and then in the Voice settings dialog, you can choose the voice you want.
+One special item that will always appear in this list is "No speech", which allows you to use NVDA with no speech output what so ever.
+This may be useful for  someone who wishes to only use NVDA with Braille, or  perhaps to sighted developers who only wish to use the Speech Viewer.

+==== Output device ====
+This option allows you to choose the sound card that NVDA should instruct the selected synthesizer to speak through.
