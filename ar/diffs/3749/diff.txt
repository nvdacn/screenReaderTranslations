-The Most common way of navigating around Windows with NVDA, is to just move around with normal keyboard commands, such as tab and shift tab to move forward and back between controls, pressing alt to get to the menu bar and then using the arrows to navigate menus, using alt+tab to move between running applications. As you do this, NVDA will announce what has focus.
-
-When NVDA announces an object (e.g. when it receives the System focus), it will usually say the object's name, type, state, value, description, keyboard shortcut, and positional information. This is quite similar to other screen readers; however the types of objects may be a little different.

 ++ Object Navigation ++
-If you wish to navigate around the current application or the Operating System a bit, but with out moving the focus, you can use NVDA's object navigation. This allows you to move from object to object in a tree like structure.
-
-The tree structure of objects starts at the desktop window, the root of the tree. The first branches of the tree are the currently running applications, and of course these applications have their own branches (objects), representing various parts of the application.
-
-The tree structure can get quite large, but it does allow you to navigate in a logical order, so that you can quickly find the information you need.
-
-This structure has nothing to do with how the objects are laid out on the screen, but how they are related logically. This may take a little bit of time to get used to, but once you grasp this, you should be able to move around quite easily.
-
-Not all applications have a perfect tree structure, but this is up to the developer of that particular application. Most seem to be ok; certainly most Dialog boxes and highly structured applications seem to have gotten it right.
+If you wish to explore the current application or the Operating System without moving the focus, you can use NVDA's object navigation.
+This allows you to move between and obtain information about individual objects such as text, buttons, checkboxes, sliders, lists and editable text fields.
+When you move to an object, NVDA will report it similarly to the way it reports the system focus.
+
+Rather than having to move back and forth between every single object on the system, the objects are grouped hierarchically.
+This means that you must move inside some objects to access the objects they contain.
+For example, instead of moving through all list items when a list is encountered, you must move inside the list (i.e. navigate to its first child object) in order to access its items.
+You can move out of the list (navigate to the parent object) to continue past the list.
+Similarly, if you encounter a toolbar, you must move inside the toolbar (navigate to its first child) to access the controls in the toolbar.
 
 By default, the navigator object moves along with the System focus, though this behaviour can be toggled on and off.

 As well as reviewing the content of a single object, NVDA allows you to review the entire content of a document or the text of the screen.
 This is called flat review.
