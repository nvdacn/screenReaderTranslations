This section contains information about the Braille displays supported by NVDA.

== Freedom Scientific Focus/PAC Mate Series ==
All Focus and PAC Mate displays from [Freedom Scientific http://www.freedomscientific.com/] are supported.
You will need the Freedom Scientific braille display drivers installed on your system.
If you do not have them already, you can obtain them from http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/focus-40-blue/focus-40-blue-downloads.asp.
Although this page only mentions the Focus 40 Blue display, the driver supports all Freedom Scientific displays.

== Optelec ALVA BC640/680 ==
Both the ALVA BC640 and BC680 displays from [Optelec http://www.optelec.com/] are supported.
You do not need any specific drivers to be installed to use these displays.
Just plug in the display and configure NVDA to use it.

== Handy Tech Displays ==
NVDA supports all displays from [Handy Tech http://www.handytech.de/].
If you are using a USB display, you will need to install the USB drivers from Handy Tech on your system.
In addition, you will need to install the Handy Tech universal driver, available at ftp://ftp.handytech.de/public/Software/BrailleDriver/bsd1111a.exe

== MDV Lilli ==
The Lilli braille display available from [MDV http://www.mdvbologna.it/] is supported.
You do not need any specific drivers to be installed to use this display.
Just plug in the display and configure NVDA to use it.

== BRLTTY ==
[BRLTTY http://mielke.cc/brltty/] is a separate program which can be used to support many more braille displays.
In order to use this, you need to install [BRLTTY for Windows http://brl.thefreecat.org/brltty/].
You should download and install the latest installer package, which will be named, for example, brltty-win-4.2-2.exe.
When configuring the display and port to use, be sure to pay close attention to the instructions, especially if you are using a USB display and already have the manufacturer's drivers installed.}+
