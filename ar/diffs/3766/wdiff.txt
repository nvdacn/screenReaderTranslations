++ Speech Synthesizer Support ++
Apart from providing its messages and interface in several languages, NVDA can also enable the user to read content in any language, as long as they have a speech synthesizer that can speak that language.


NVDA is bundled with [eSpeak http://espeak.sourceforge.net/], a free, open-source, multi-lingual speech synthesizer.
Additionally, NVDA can use both SAPI4 and SAPI5 speech engines to provide speech output, as well as the Audiologic and NewFon speech synthesizers.

One is an Installer which will talk you through installing NVDA so that you can then run it at any time from the Start Menu.
The other is a self-extracting archive file that contains a fully portable version of NVDA, which you can run from anywhere, including a USB thumb drive or CD.

If you already have the NVDA installer, simply press enter or double click on the file and the installer will start.




As the installer loads, you will hear the NVDA installation music.
Once loaded, a temporary copy of NVDA will allow you to follow the prompts of the installer and install NVDA.
Note that if you were running another copy of NVDA at the time you started the installer, a message will appear telling you that your previous copy of NVDA will be closed.
When you press enter on this message, the installer will close your previous copy and start its own one.
This is necessary so that the installer can properly update any changed files.
At this point, if you have another copy of NVDA already installed, the NVDA installer will uninstall it for you, and then it will commence to install NVDA.

Once you have successfully completed the installation, the installer will alert you that the install of NVDA has finished.
If reinstalling NVDA, It may ask you to reboot the system at this point.
It is very important that you reboot the system as failing to do so will have undesirable consequences.
If it did not ask you to reboot, pressing Finnish will close the installer and start the newly installed version of NVDA.

To start the portable version, go to the directory you unpacked NVDA to, and press enter or double click on nvda.exe.






As NVDA starts, you will first hear an ascending set of tones (telling you that NVDA is loading).
Depending on how fast your computer is, or if you are running NVDA off a USB key or other slower medium, it may take a little while to start.
If it is taking an extra long time, NVDA should say "Loading NVDA. Please wait..."

If you don't hear any of this, or you hear the Windows error sound, or a descending set of tones, then this means that NVDA has an error, and you will need to possibly report a bug to the developers.

Most NVDA-specific keyboard commands usually consist of pressing  a particular  key called   the NVDA modifier key, in conjunction with one or more other keys.
An exception to this are the text review commands which just use the numpad keys by themselves.

NVDA can be configured so that either the numpad Insert, Extended Insert, or capslock key can be used as the NVDA modifier key.

Where supported, NVDA will read a paragraph's worth of text, though some controls may only read by line.

NVDA can also be configured to also announce the type of control or object the mouse is currently over as it moves (e.g. list, button etc), which may be useful for totally blind users as sometimes the text isn't enough.


NVDA provides a way for users to understand where the mouse is in regards to the dimentions of the screen, by playing the current mouse coordinates as audio beeps.
The higher the mouse is on the screen, the higher the pitch of the beeps.
The more left or right the mouse is on the screen, the more left or right the sound will seem to come from (assuming the user has stereo speakers).

A virtual buffer is a flat representation of content such as a web page, that can be moved around in with the arrow keys.
Information such as whether text is a link, heading etc is announced along with the text as you move.

While in a virtual buffer, there are two modes of interaction.

Browse mode is where you can move around all the text using a virtual cursor, rather like the system caret.
In fact all of NVDA's system caret key commands will work in this mode (e.g. say all, report formatting, all table navigation commands etc).
Focus mode is where you can directly interact with the control (edit field, combo box, radio buttons) using what ever keys you would normally use.



When in Browse mode, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it.
Note that pressing enter or space on controls that require it will also switch to focus mode.
If NVDA has automatically switched to focus mode, tabbing to, or clicking on, an object that does not need focus mode (such as a link or peace of text) will switch back to browse mode.
Pressing escape will also switch back to browse mode if it was switched to focus mode automatically.
You can manually change between focus and browse modes as well.
Though when changing to focus mode manually, NVDA will lock to that particular mode and no longer automatically switch, unless you manually change back to browse mode.

The Synthesizer dialog, which is found under "Synthesizer..." in the Preferences menu, allows you to select which Synthesizer NVDA should use to speak with.


The dialog contains a simple combo box, which lists all the available synthesizers.
Choose the synthesizer you want using the arrow keys, and then press ok.
If there is an error loading the synthesizer, a message box will alert you, and NVDA will keep the old synthesizer loaded.

The current list of synthesizers NVDA supports is: eSpeak, SAPI4, SAPI5, Audiologic, and Silence.






The eSpeak synthesizer is built directly in to NVDA, and does not depend on any other special drivers or SAPI runtime to be installed.
NVDA starts using eSpeak by default.
This synthesizer should work on any system that NVDA works on, so it will definitely work when running NVDA off a USB thumb drive or CD, on anyone else's system.

The Sapi4 option allows you to use the Sapi synthesizer.
Voices that are included under Ssapi4 include eloquence voices, as well as other Ssapi4 voices that you may have installed on your system.

The Sapi5 synthesizer allows you to use the microsoft voices that are iincluded on your machine.
In XP, the default Ssapi5 voice is Microsoft Sam.
In Vista, the default voice is Microsoft Anna.
Depending on what voices you have installed, others may show up under Ssapi5.

The Silence synthesizer driver is not that useful, unless you want to not have any speech at all while running NVDA.

Please note that no matter how many different SAPI4 or SAPI5 voices (or engines) you have installed on your system, only the actual SAPI4 and SAPI5 synthesizers will show up in the Synthesizers dialog.

The speech dictionaries menu (found in the Preferences menu) contains dialogs that allow you to manage the way NVDA pronounces particular words or phrases.
There are currently three different types of speech dictionaries.
They are:
- Default: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA.
- Voice: rules in this dictionary affect speech for the synthesizer voice currently being used.
- Temporary: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA, but only for the current session. These rules are temporary and will be lost if NVDA is restarted.
-






All dictionary dialogs contain a list of rules which will be used for processing the speech.
The dialog also contains Add, Edit and remove buttons.


To add a new rule to the dictionary, press the Add button, and fill in the fields in the dialog box that appears and then press Ok.
You will then see your new rule in the list of rules.
However to make sure your rule is actually saved, make sure to press Ok to exit the dictionary dialog all together once you have finished adding/editing rules.

The rules for NVDA's speech dictionaries allow you to change one string of characters in to another.
A simple example would be that you want to have NVDA say the word frog each time it is supposed to say the word bird.
In the Add rule dialog, the easiest way to do this is to type the word bird in the Pattern field, and the word frog in the Replacement field.
You may also want to type a description of the rule in the Comment field (something like: changes bird to frog).

NVDA's speech dictionaries however are much more powerful than simple word replacement.
The Add rule dialog also contains a checkbox to say whether or not you want the rule to be case sensitive (meaning that NVDA should care whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase.
NVDA ignores case by default).
Another chekbox allows you to state whether your pattern is a "Regular expression".
A regular expression is a pattern containing special symbols that allow you to match on more than one character at a time, or match on just numbers, or just letters, as a few examples.
Regular expressions are not covered in this user guide, but there are many tutorials on the web which can provide you with more information.
