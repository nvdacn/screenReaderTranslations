The console is similar to the standard interactive Python interpreter. Input is accepted one line at a time. The current line is processed when enter is pressed. You can navigate through the history of previously entered lines using the up and down arrow keys. 
Output (responses from the interpreter) will be spoken when enter is pressed. The f6 key toggles between the input and output controls. 
Closing the console window simply hides it. This allows the user to return to the session as it was left when it was closed, including history and variables. 

=== Namespace ===
==== Automatic Imports ====
For convenience, the following modules and variables are automatically imported in the console: sys, os, wx, log (from logHandler), api, queueHandler, speech, braille 

==== Snapshot Variables ====
Whenever NVDA+control+z is pressed, certain variables available in the console will be assigned according to the current state of NVDA. These variables are: 
- focus: The current focus object 
- focusAnc: The ancestors of the current focus object 
- fdl: Focus difference level; i.e. the level at which the ancestors for the current and previous focus differ 
- fg: The current foreground object 
- nav: The current navigator object 
- review: The TextInfo instance representing the current position of the review cursor
- mouse: The current mouse object 
- brlRegions: The braille regions from the active braille buffer
