-- The sayAll by Navigator object (NVDA+numpadAdd), navigator object next in flow (NVDA+numpad6) and navigator object previous in flow (NVDA+numpad4) have been removed for the time being, due to buggyness and to free up the keys for other possible features.
+- The sayAll by Navigator object (NVDA+numpadAdd), navigator object next in flow (NVDA+shift+numpad6) and navigator object previous in flow (NVDA+shift+numpad4) have been removed for the time being, due to bugginess and to free up the keys for other possible features.
 - In the NVDA Synthesizer dialog, only the display name of the synthesizer is now listed. Previously, it was prefixed by the driver's name, which is only relevant internally.
+- When in embedded applications or virtual buffers inside another virtualBuffer (e.g. Flash), you can now  press nvda+control+space to move out of the embedded application or virtual buffer, in to the above document. Previously nvda+space  was used for this. Now nvda+space is specifically only for toggling brows/focus modes on virtualBuffers.
 - If the speech viewer (enabled under the tools menu) is given the focus (e.g. it was clicked in) new text will not appear in the control until focus is moved away. This allows for selecting the text with greater ease (e.g. for copying).
