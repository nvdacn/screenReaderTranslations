 - When moving the mouse over cells in Microsoft Excel, NVDA will appropriately announce them.

 == Changes ==
 - The sayAll by Navigator object (NVDA+numpadAdd), navigator object next in flow (NVDA+numpad6) and navigator object previous in flow (NVDA+numpad4) have been removed for the time being, due to buggyness and to free up the keys for other possible features.
- 
+- In the NVDA Synthesizer dialog, only the display name of the synthesizer is now listed. Previously, it was prefixed by the driver's name, which is only relevant internally.
 
+
 == Bug Fixes ==
 - In ÂµTorrent, the focused item in the torrents list no longer reports repeatedly or steals focus when a menu is open.
