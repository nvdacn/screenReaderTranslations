 The Silence synthesizer driver is not that useful, unless you want to not have any speech at all while running NVDA.

 Please note that no matter how many different SAPI4 or SAPI5 voices (or engines) you have installed on your system, only the actual SAPI4 and SAPI5 synthesizers will show up in the Synthesizers dialog. To actually select one of the engines (voices), select either SAPI4 or SAPI5, and then in the Voice settings dialog, you can choose the voice you want.

-When pressing NVDA+Control+T, you can control what is being displayed on the braille display. The two options are focus and review. Focus displays what is being accessed via the arrow keys, the tab key, in short, focus navigation. Review allows you to review what is on the screen, I.E object navigation. You can cycle between these options by pressing control+NVDA+T.
+This option allows you to choose whether the braille display will follow the system focus, or whether it follows the navigator object / review cursor.

-While in a virtual buffer, there are two modes of interaction. Browse mode is where you can move around all the text using a virtual cursor. Focus mode is where you can directly interact with the control (edit field, combo box, radio buttons) using what ever keys you would normally use. When in Browse mode, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it. Note that pressing enter or space on controls that require it will also switch to focus mode. You can also manually change to focus mode with NVDA+space. If NVDA automatically changed to focus mode because of a tab, click or enter/space key press, it will change back to browse mode once you tab or click on to something that doesn't require it, or if you press escape. However, if you changed to focus mode with NVDA+space, it will stay in focus mode until you manually go back to browse mode. At any time when you are in focus mode, you can manually switch back to browse mode by pressing escape, or NVDA+space. The virtual buffer settings dialog in the preferences menu in the NVDA menu allows you to disable automatic switching of browse mode and focus mode.

 Pages can include rich content using technologies such as Adobe Flash and Sun Java. Where these are encountered in a virtual buffer, NVDA will announce "embedded object". You can press enter on these objects to interact with them. If it is accessible, you can then tab around it and interact with it like any other application. To return to the page, press NVDA+space.
