+In this dialog, you can customize the input gestures (keys on the keyboard, buttons on a braille display, etc.) for NVDA commands.
+
+Only commands that are applicable immediately before the dialog is opened are shown.
+For example, if you want to customize commands related to browse mode, you should open the Input Gestures dialog while you are in browse mode.

+The tree in this dialog lists all of the applicable NVDA commands grouped by category.
+Any gestures associated with a command are listed beneath the command.

+To add an input gesture to a command, select the command and press the Add button.
+Then, perform the input gesture you wish to associate; e.g. press a key on the keyboard or a button on a braille display.
+Often, a gesture can be interpreted in more than one way.
+For example, if you pressed a key on the keyboard, you may wish it to be specific to the current keyboard layout (e.g. desktop or laptop) or you may wish it to apply for all layouts.
+In this case, a menu will appear allowing you to select the desired option.

-++ Remapping Key Assignments and Other Input Gestures ++
-Users are able to provide or override mappings of input gestures (such as key presses) to scripts in a special file in the user's NVDA configuration directory.
-This file is called gestures.ini.
-
-This file uses standard ini syntax.
-The file may contain multiple sections and each section may have one or more entries.
-
-Each section provides mappings for scripts in a particular Python module and class inside NVDA.
-- The section name should be the Python module and class separated by a dot (.).
-- The key of each entry is the name of the script to which input gestures should be bound.
-Alternatively, you can use None to unbind input gestures from a script to which they were previously bound.
-Each entry key can only be listed once per section, including None.
-- The entry value is a comma (,) separated list of gesture identifiers for the input gestures that should be bound.
-Gesture identifiers ending in a comma must be enclosed in quotes (" or ').
--
-
-Gesture identifiers consist of a two letter device code; a sub-device, layout or mode in brackets; a colon; and then a type-specific string identifying the actual input, such as key or touch gesture names.
-- For keyboard gestures, the device code is kb.
-The part in brackets is the keyboard layout and is optional.
-If not specified, the gesture will apply to all keyboard layouts.
-The string after the colon is one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.
-- For braille display gestures, the device code is br.
-The part in brackets identifies the specific braille display and is mandatory.
-The string after the colon is one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.
-- For touch gestures, the device code is ts.
-The part in brackets is the touch mode and is optional.
-The string after the colon is a touch gesture; e.g. double_tap, 2fingerflickUp or 3finger_tap.
--
-
-In order to discover gesture identifiers, script names and the class and module in which they are contained, you can:
-+ Turn on Input Help.
-+ Activate the gesture (press the key, touch the screen, etc.).
-+ Turn off input help.
-+ Activate View log in the NVDA Tools menu.
-+ Examine the recent log entries.
-One of these should provide information about the input gesture you sent, including the module.class and script if it is bound to one.
-+
-
-Following is an example of how you could bind NVDA+shift+t to the date time script.
-
-To find out the correct script name and module.class for date time, you would turn on Input Help and press NVDA+f12 (as this is the current gesture for the date time script).
-You would then turn off Input Help and examine the log viewer.
-
-Towards the bottom, you would see:
-
-```
-INFO - inputCore.InputManager._handleInputHelp (13:17:22):
-Input help: gesture kb(desktop):NVDA+f12, bound to script dateTime on globalCommands.GlobalCommands
-```
-
-From this, you can see that the script name is dateTime and the module.class is globalCommands.GlobalCommands.
-
-If the file does not yet exist, you would create a text file called gestures.ini in the user configuration directory and add the following content:
-
-```
-[globalCommands.GlobalCommands]
-	dateTime = kb:NVDA+shift+t
-```
-
-This would bind the key press NVDA+shift+t (in any keyboard layout) to the dateTime script.
-
-Note that the original NVDA+f12 binding would still work.
-If you wanted to remove this binding, you would add the following line:
-
-```
-	None = kb:NVDA+f12
-```

 ++ Advanced Customization of Symbol Pronunciation ++
 It is possible to customize the pronunciation of punctuation and other symbols beyond what can be done using the [Punctuation/symbol pronunciation #SymbolPronunciation] dialog.
 For example, you can specify whether the raw symbol should be sent to the synthesizer (e.g. to cause a pause or change in inflection) and you can add custom symbols.
