Synth algorithm for  reading an arabic text
1. If all vowels are written then synth should read all text.
Subrules:
a) If synth sees any word with the defininite article "الْ" after any word then synth shouldn't  read alif in this article. This case of the language is
 called همزة الوصل - hamzatu-l-wasl.
Example:
هَمْزَةُ الْوَصْلِ - (alif shouldn't be read because the alif-lam is written after any word. there is a word hamzatu in this example. so, the synth should
 read هَمْزَةُلْوَصْلِ together)
Example:
كِتَابُ الْوَلَدِ - (the same case - كِتَابُلْوَلَدِ together)
مِنَ الْبَيْتِ - (the same case)
b) If the word with the article alif-lam is the first word in the sentence
 then synth should read alif with hamza.
Example:
الْقَلَمُ جَدِيدٌ. - (the word الْقَلَمُ is the first in this example. so,
 synth should read this alif with the hamza as أَلْقَلَمُ) 
الْبِنْتُ جَمِيلَةٌ. - (the same case - أَلْبِنْتُ)
c) If synth sees after any word a period, comma, question sign, exclamation
 sign or any punctuation, where the phrase is interrupted then the last vowel
 shouldn't  be read with the synth.
Example:
قَرَأَ الْكِتَابَ. - (the last vowel fatha فَتْحَةٌ shouldn't be read with
 the synth because of the period at the end of this example. so, الكِتَابْ
 is read)
Example:
هَلْ عِنْدَهُ سَيَّارَةٌ قَدِيمَةٌ؟ - (the last ta-marbuta with the damma-tan
 تَنْوِينُ الضَّمَّةِ فَوقِ التَّاءِ الْمَرْبُوطَةِ isn't read because of
 question sign. so, the word قَدِيمَةٌ is read as قَدِيمَ)
Example:
أَهْلاً وَمَرْحَبًا! - (the same case but with alif at the and of sentence and
 تَنْوِينُ الْفَتْحَةِ فَوْقِ الْأَلِفِ  because of the exclamation sign. so,
 the word مَرْحَبًا is read مَرْحَبَا)
