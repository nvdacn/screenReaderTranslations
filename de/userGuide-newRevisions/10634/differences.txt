==== Audio indication of Focus and Browse modes ====
 If this option is enabled, NVDA will play special sounds when it switches between browse mode and focus mode, rather than speaking the change.
 
+==== Trap non-command gestures from reaching the document ====
+Enabled by default, this option allows you to choose if gestures (such as key presses) that  do not result in an NVDA command and are not considered to be a command key in general, should be trapped from going through to the document you are currently focused on. 
+As an example, if enabled, if the letter j was pressed, it would be trapped from reaching the document, even though it is not a quick navigation command nor is it likely to be a command in the application itself.
