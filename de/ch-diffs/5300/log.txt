message:
  Fetching the role property in chooseNVDAObjectOverlayClasses no longer causes the role to be incorrect and thus not reported on focus for certain objects such as Windows command consoles and Scintilla controls.
  To fix this, IAccessible.role is no longer cached, as it relies on other properties which might change once overlay classes are applied.
