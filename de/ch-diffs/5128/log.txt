message:
  Implementation of #123 (quick nav scripts to jump to the start, or past the end, of the current containing element). Use "kb:shift+," and "kb:shift+." (< and >). Should be able to work within tables, lists, multiline edit, frames, blockquotes, editable documents (pretty much anything that would announce "out of xxx").

Addressed review comments for #123 implementation - mostly translator comments.
