message:
  core.restart: When converting strings to unicode, use mbcs so that non-ASCII characters get converted properly instead of throwing an exception.
  This means that NVDA now restarts itself correctly (e.g. after changing the configured language) when it is located in a directory which contains non-ASCII characters.
