message:
  Fix for #1662, NVDA will no longer announce dynamic content changes such as in Dos consoles if that application's sleep mode is toggled on. 
  Specifically:
  	* api.setFocusObject: use eventHandler.executeEvent to fire the loseFocus on the previous focus rather than calling it directly on the NVDAObject. This allows the vent to be customized at any level (appModule, global plugins, virtualBuffers etc) but more importantly will block it if sleep mode is on.
  	* toggle sleep mode script (NVDA+shift+s): when turning sleep mode on, fire a loseFocus event on the current focus, and when turning it off fire a gainFocus.
