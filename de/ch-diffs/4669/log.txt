message:
  Excel: allow NVDA to read / interact with the active cell in Microsoft Excel after pasting into it with control+v. Fixes #1781.  It seems that the excel cell object we are holding completely dies in every way if it is pasted into... so class control+v as a selection change command, so that pressing this forces NVDA to correct its idea of the active cell.
