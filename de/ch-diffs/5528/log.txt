message:
  MSHTML browse mode: correctly render content  with style visibility:visible even when inside an element with style visibility:hidden. For example on http://hbleit.bbi.is/Account/Login.aspx there is a visible  edit field inside a hidden table.
  Specific changes:
  	* VBufStorage_fieldNode_t: add an isHidden property and related setIsHidden method. IsHidden is set to true by default on initializeation. Also expose this property as an attribute in the XML.
  	* VBufStorage_buffer_t: when searching for a node by given attributes, skip any node whos isHidden property is true.
  	* MSHTML VBufBackend: handle visibility:hidden separate to display:none and aria-hidden, by still rendering children for visibility:hidden, but not rendering direct content. Also set isHidden to true on nodes that have visibility:hidden so that they are skipped when searching (quicknav etc).
  	* speech.getControlFieldSpeech: do not generate any control field text at all for a controlField who has an isHidden attribute set to true.
