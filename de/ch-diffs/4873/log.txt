message:
  Generalise some code which is not specific to speech.
  speech.REASON_* constants have been moved to controlTypes.
  In controlTypes, speechRoleLabels and speechStateLabels have been renamed to just roleLabels and stateLabels, respectively.
  Moved some other code out of speech so that braille no longer uses stuff from speech.
