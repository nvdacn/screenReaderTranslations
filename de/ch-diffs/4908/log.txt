message:
  When the caret or review cursor moves, braille is now scrolled in the same way as when it is manually scrolled. This makes it more appropriate when braille is configured to read by paragraphs and/or avoid splitting words.
  Also, when setting endPos, correctly handle the word wrap case where the window is right at the start of a word.
