message:
  Support for SAPI 5.4 voices. Fixes #1735.
  Specifically:
  	* sapi5 synth driver: move the COM_class constant from module level to class level.
  	* add sapi5_4.py which implements a SynthDriver which subclasses the sapi5 one, but overrides COM_class to point to speech.spVoice rather than sapi.spVoice.
