message:
  EditTextInfo and ITextDocumentTextInfo now both always convert any fetched text to a string of '*' characters if the object the TextInfo is for has its protected state set. This change is mostly for  stopping announcement of passwords in Outlook but there are certainly other cases seen as well. Fixes #2021.
