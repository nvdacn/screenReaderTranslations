 == New Features ==
 - NVDA can now automatically check for, download and install updates. (#73)
+- Management of custom plugins and drivers for NVDA has been made easier with the addition of an Add-ons Manager (found under Tools in the NVDA menu) allowing you to install and uninstall NVDA add-on packages (.nvda-addon files). (#213)
 - Many more common NVDA features now work in Windows 8 Metro style apps when using an installed release  of NVDA, including speaking of typed characters, and browse mode for web documents (includes support for metro version of Internet Explorer 10). Portable copies of NVDA cannot access metro style apps. (#1801) 
 - In browse mode documents (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.), you can now  jump to the start and past the end of certain containing elements (such as lists and tables) with shift+, and shift+. respectively. (#123)
 - New language: Greek.
