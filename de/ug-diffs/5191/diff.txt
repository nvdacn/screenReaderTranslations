 The Add-ons Manager contains a list that displays all the add-ons currently installed in your NVDA user configuration. 
 A package name, version and author are shown for each add-on, though further information such as a description and URL can be viewed by selecting the add-on and pressing the About add-on button.
 
-To install an Add-on, press the Add button.
+To install an Add-on, press the Install button.
 This will allow you to browse for an add-on package (.nvda-addon file) somewhere on your computer or on a network.
 Once you press Open, NVDA will ask if you really wish to install the add-on.
 As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.
