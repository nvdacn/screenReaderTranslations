+Object navigation allows you to move between and obtain information about individual [objects #Objects].
 When you move to an object, NVDA will report it similarly to the way it reports the system focus.
 For a way to review all text as it appears on the screen, you can instead use [flat review #FlatReview].
 
 Rather than having to move back and forth between every single object on the system, the objects are organized hierarchically.
 This means that some objects contain other objects and you must move inside them to access the objects they contain.
 For example, a list contains list items, so you must move inside the list in order to access its items.
-If you have moved to a list item, you can move to its containing object to get back to the list and then move past it if you wish.

 When in Browse mode, by default, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it.
 Conversely, tabbing to or clicking on a control that does not require focus mode will switch back to browse mode.
 You can also press enter or space to switch to focus mode on controls that require it.
