 ==== Inflection ====
 This option is a slider that lets you choose how much inflection (rise and fall in pitch) the synthesizer should use to speak with. (The only synthesizer that provides this option at the present time is eSpeak).
 
+==== Automatic Language switching ====
+This checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not NVDA should switch speech synthesizer languages on the fly, if language markup is available in the text being read.
+This option is enabled by default.
+Currently only the eSpeak synthesizer supports automatic language switching.

+==== Automatic Dialect switching ====
+If automatic language switching is turned on, this checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not  dialect changes should be made, rather than just actual language changes. E.g. If reading in an English U.S. voice but a document states some text is in English U.K. then if this feature is enabled the synthesizer will switch accents.
