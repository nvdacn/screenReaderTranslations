    Support for the OCR engine included in Windows 10. (#7361)
    
    This accesses the UWP OCR API via code in the nvdaHelperLocalWin10 C++/CX dll.
    Users press NVDA+r to recognize the text of the current navigator object. Once recognition is complete, the result is presented in a document which can be read with the cursor keys, etc. Enter can also be pressed to click the text at the cursor.
    Much of the base content recognition functionality has been abstracted into the new contentRecog framework, allowing other recognizers to be easily implemented in future (in both NVDA core and add-ons).
