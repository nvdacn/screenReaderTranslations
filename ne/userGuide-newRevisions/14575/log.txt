    Introduse the ability to postpone a downloaded update #4263 (#6355)
    
    * initial work on postponeing updates
    
    * Removed undesired code from the source and userdocs and added some copyright notices
    
    * Review actions
    
    * Some major code updates to make this actually work, hopefully
    
    * Fixed translator comment
    
    * Some more fixes, still some testing to be done
    
    * Support updating of portable copies
    
    * Review actions
    
    * More review actions
    
    * Actions for user guide
    
    * Fixed issue where a right paren was placed at the wrong position
    
    * Properly evaluate whether to show or hide the pending updates menu item on every time the menu is opened. Binding this evaluation to the item itself made the item never to show up.
    
    * Don't use the file variable name when looping through possible old updates. This broke the loading of the state file. Added state file loading debug logging while at it.
    
    * Properly destroy the UpdateResultDialog when installing a postponed update
    
    * When updating a portable copy, run NVDA with the -m command line argument
    
    * Fix KeyError on updating
    
    * make sure that the update state file will be updated to contain pending update info
    
    * When updating a portable copy, place paths that are provided as command line params between quotes to deal with paths containing spaces
    
    * Fix crash after restart with a postponed update
    
    * No longer add removeFile to the update state, as it is used nowhere
    
    * Call prePopup before raising the UpdateAskInstallDialog and make it modal
    
    * Use runScriptModalDialog for the UpdateAskInstallDialog
    
    * Clear the don't remind version when postponing an update. If we do not do this, a user will never be reminded about a postponed update automatically at all
