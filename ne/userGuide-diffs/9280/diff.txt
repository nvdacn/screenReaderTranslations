 When NVDA starts for the first time, you will be greeted by a dialog box which provides you with some basic information about the NVDA modifier key and the NVDA menu.
 (Please see further sections about these topics.)
-The dialog box also contains two checkboxes.
-The first lets you control if NVDA should use the capslock as an NVDA modifier key, and the second lets you control if this Welcome dialog should appear each time NVDA starts.
+The dialog box also contains three checkboxes.

 The Add-ons Manager contains a list that displays all the add-ons currently installed in your NVDA user configuration. 
 A package name, version and author are shown for each add-on, though further information such as a description and URL can be viewed by selecting the add-on and pressing the About add-on button.
 
-To install an Add-on, press the Install button.
+To browse and download availible add-ons online, press the Get add-ons button.
+This button opens the [NVDA Add-ons page http://addons.nvda-project.org/].
+If NVDA is installed on your system, you can open the add-on directly from the browser to begin the installation process as described below.
+Otherwise, save the add-on package and follow the instructions below.
+
+To install an Add-on you previously obtained, press the Install button.
 This will allow you to browse for an add-on package (.nvda-addon file) somewhere on your computer or on a network.
-Once you press Open, NVDA will ask if you really wish to install the add-on.
+Once you press Open, the installation process will begin.
+
+When an add-on is being installed, NVDA will first ask you to confirm that you really wish to install the add-on.
 As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.
 Once the add-on is installed, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running. 
 Until you do, a status of "install" will show for that add-on in the list.
