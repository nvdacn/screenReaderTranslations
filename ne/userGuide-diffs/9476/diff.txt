++++ Input Gestures (NVDA+control+i) +++
+In this dialog, you can customize the input gestures (keys on the keyboard, buttons on a braille display, etc.) for NVDA commands.
+
+Only commands that are applicable immediately before the dialog is opened are shown.
+Therefore, you should generally open this dialog using its key command so that all commands applicable to what you were just doing are shown.
+For example, if you want to customize commands related to browse mode, you should press the key command to open the Input Gestures dialog while you are in browse mode.
+
+The tree in this dialog lists all of the applicable NVDA commands grouped by category.
+Any gestures associated with a command are listed beneath the command.
+
+To add an input gesture to a command, select the command and press the Add button.
+Then, perform the input gesture you wish to associate; e.g. press a key on the keyboard or a button on a braille display.
+Often, a gesture can be interpreted in more than one way.
+For example, if you pressed a key on the keyboard, you may wish it to be specific to the current keyboard layout (e.g. desktop or laptop) or you may wish it to apply for all layouts.
+In this case, a menu will appear allowing you to select the desired option.
+
+To remove a gesture from a command, select the gesture and press the Remove button.

+Although you are free to have scripts bound to any available key, it may be problematic to use the alt key on the keyboard.
+NVDA still sends modifier keys (such as shift, control and alt) to the Operating System, even if they eventuate in a script.
+Thus, if you do use alt in a gesture, pressing this key combination may activate the menu bar, as well as executing the script.
+Therefore, it is probably best to just use Shift, control and the NVDA modifier key as modifiers.
