  Fix for #2780. Now NVDA can again function in the Yahoo! Mail message list when viewed from Internet Explorer. Specifically: Tightened up the rule that ignores names calculated from descendants for MSHTML grouping nodes. Now only ignore groupings that are specifically DIV notes and the NVDA role is grouping, as opposed to the accRole only being grouping.
