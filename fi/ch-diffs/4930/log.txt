message:
  Dialog NVDAObject behavior: Always skip labels for adjacent objects, as this was causing us to incorrectly include labels for objects which weren't themselves included.
  Instead, always include the name of an object itself if it is not included in its text.
  Fixes incorrect reporting of editable text field labels in some dialogs.
