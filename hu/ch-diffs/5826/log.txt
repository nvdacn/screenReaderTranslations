message:
  Allow reporting of groups in 64-bit SysListView32 controls (e.g. 64-bit Internet Explorer's Add-ons manager).
  Resorted to using an rpc call as LVGROUP's pszHeader and pszFooter members in 64-bit apps seem to be allocated above the 32-bit boundary, and when manually allocated by us causes a crash due to what seems to be a bug (or incorrect documentation) in commctrl
