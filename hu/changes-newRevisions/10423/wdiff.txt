== Changes ==
- If an object you have moved to with object navigation is inside a browse mode document, but the object you were on previously was not, the review mode is automatically set to document. Previously this only happened if the navigator object was moved due to the focus changing. (#4369)


== Bug Fixes ==
- When moving focus back to a browse mode document (e.g. alt tabbing to an already opened web page) the review cursor is properly positioned at the virtual caret, rather than the focused control (e.g. a near by link). (#4369)}+
