+Most NVDA-specific keyboard commands usually consist of pressing a particular key called the NVDA modifier key, in conjunction with one or more other keys.
 An exception to this are the text review commands which just use the numpad keys by themselves.
 
 NVDA can be configured so that either the numpad Insert, Extended Insert, or capslock key can be used as the NVDA modifier key.
 
 By default, both the numpad Insert and Extended Insert keys are set as NVDA modifier keys.
 
-If you wish to cause one of the NVDA modifier keys to act like its original key (for instance you wish to turn capslock on when  you have set capslock to be  an NVDA modifier key) you can press the  key twice in quick succession.
