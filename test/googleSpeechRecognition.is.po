"* To stop dictation, press the same shortcut, and this time you will hear a low pitched beep.\n"
"Note: if you do not stop the recording, it will automatically be stopped after 10 seconds.\n"
"Bare in mind the shorter time interval, the higher accuracy.\n"
"* The speech will be sent to the Google speech recognition service, and when the transcription is returned, NVDA will announce it.\n"
"* If the recognition is correct, press the accept shortcut, NVDA+g, and the text will be written to your cursor position.\n"
"* If the recognition was not correct, simply rerecord but use a smaller chunk\n"
"of words. You might need to split a long sentence into two or three chunks.\n"
"* When you want to speak in a different language, simply cycle to one of your languages and repeat the steps.\n"
