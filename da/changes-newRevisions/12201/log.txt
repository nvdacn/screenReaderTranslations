    NVDA now reports colors using a basic well-understood set of 9 color hues and 3 shades, with brightness and paleness variations. This is rather than using more subjective web color names.
    
        Hues: red, brown, orange, yellow, green, aqua, blue, purple and pink
        Shades: white, grey and black.
        Variations: bright, dark, very dark, light, pale, dark pale, very dark pale.
