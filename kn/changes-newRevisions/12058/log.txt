    In Microsoft word, NVDA no longer incorrectly reports text with an outline level (but not a built-in heading style) as a heading.
    
    NVDAHelper winword support: only expose a paragraph as a heading if the paragraph's style matches one of the builtin heading styles. This keeps heading reporting consistant with heading quicknav (which uses range.goto).
    Fixes #5186.
