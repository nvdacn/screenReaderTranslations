+- Using the Level field, you can adjust the lowest symbol level at which this symbol should be spoken.
+- The Send actual symbol to synthesizer field specifies when the symbol itself (in contrast to its replacement) should be sent to the synthesizer.
+This is useful if the symbol causes the synthesizer to pause or change the inflection of the voice.
+For example, a comma causes the synthesizer to pause.
+There are three options:
+ - never: Never send the actual symbol to the synthesizer.
+ - always: Always send the actual symbol to the synthesizer.
+ - only below symbols' level: Send the actual symbol only if the configured speech symbol level is lower than the level set for this symbol.
+ For example, you might use this so that a symbol will have its replacement spoken at higher levels without pausing, while still being indicated with a pause at lower levels.

-++ Advanced Customization of Symbol Pronunciation ++
-It is possible to customize the pronunciation of punctuation and other symbols beyond what can be done using the [Punctuation/symbol pronunciation #SymbolPronunciation] dialog.
-For example, you can specify whether the raw symbol should be sent to the synthesizer (e.g. to cause a pause or change in inflection) and you can add custom symbols.

-To do this, you must edit the symbol pronunciation information file in your NVDA user configuration directory.
-The file is called symbols-xx.dic, where xx is the language code.
-The format of this file is documented in the Symbol Pronunciation section of the NVDA Developer Guide, which is available from [the Development section of the NVDA web site http://community.nvda-project.org/wiki/Development].
-However, it is not possible for users to define complex symbols.
