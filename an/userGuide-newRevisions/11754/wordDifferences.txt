On Windows 8 and above, this option allows you to choose if NVDA should lower the volume of other applications while NVDA is speaking, or all the time while NVDA is running.
- No Ducking: NVDA will never lower the volume of other audio. 
- Duck when outputting speech and sounds: NVDA will only lower the volume of other audio when NVDA is speaking or playing sounds. This may not work for all synthesizers. 
- Always duck: NVDA will keep the volume of other audio lower the whole time NVDA is running.
