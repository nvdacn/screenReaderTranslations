    Support for uncontracted and contracted braille input. (PR #6449; issues #2439, #6054, #6113, #6935)
    
    Beyond the main code in brailleInput to support uncontracted/contracted input, this includes the following changes:
    * The list of braille tables has been moved out of the braille module into a separate brailleTables module. Braille tables are now added with a function rather than directly adding them to the data structure. Aside from being necessary in order to specify and check whether a table is contracted, this also makes the data about tables more extensible in future.
    * As the data structure for braille tables has now changed and is no longer ordered, this was a good opportunity to sort the list of tables alphabetically when displaying them to the user.
    * Updated to liblouis master shortly after release 3.2.0. The post 3.2.0 commits include some important back-translation fixes for UEB.
    * brailleInput is now notified when reverting config or changing config profiles. This is necessary because brailleInput now maintains some state when the input table is changed.
    * brailleInput is now initialised before braille at startup. This is because braille depends on brailleInput to get the currently untranslated input.
    * Dot7 and dot8 are now universally bound to braille input specific scripts for erase and enter. Any braille display drivers that had bindings for backspace/enter for braille input have been adjusted accordingly.
    * In the User Guide, a "Braille" section has been added above "Application Specific Features". The "Braille Control Types and States" section has been moved to a sub-section of this, and a sub-section on Braille Input has been added.
    * Added a Unicode braille input table.
