 == Changes ==
 - In NVDA's Document Formatting settings dialog, the option to report spelling errors now has a shortcut key (alt+r). (#793)
+- NVDA will now use the synthesizer/voice's language for character and symbol processing (
+including punctuation symbol names), whether or not automatic language switching is turned on or not. To turn off this feature so that NVDA again uses its interface language, uncheck the new option in Voice settings called Trust Voice's language when processing characters and symbols. (#4210)
