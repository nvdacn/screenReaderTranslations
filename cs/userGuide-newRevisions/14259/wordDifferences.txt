Welcome to NVDA!

NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free and open source screen reader for the Microsoft Windows operating system.
Providing feedback via synthetic speech and Braille, it enables blind or vision impaired people to access computers running Windows for no more cost than a sighted person.
NVDA is developed by [NV Access https://www.nvaccess.org/], with contributions from the community.


++ General Features -{++}- +{++[GeneralFeatures]}+

It is important that people anywhere in the world, no matter what language they speak, get equal access to technology.
Besides English, NVDA has been translated into 51 languages including: Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Aragonese, Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Colombian Spanish, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Farsi, Finnish, French, Galician, Georgian, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Nepali, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Thai, Traditional and Simplified Chinese, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.


++ Speech Synthesizer Support -{++}- +{++[SpeechSynthesizerSupport]}+
Apart from providing its messages and interface in several languages, NVDA can also enable the user to read content in any language, as long as they have a speech synthesizer that can speak that language.

NVDA is bundled with [eSpeak NG https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng], a free, open-source, multi-lingual speech synthesizer.

Information about other speech synthesizers that NVDA supports can be found in the [Supported Speech Synthesizers #SupportedSpeechSynths] section.


++ Braille support -{++}- +{++[BrailleSupport]}+
For users that own a refreshable braille display, NVDA can output its information in braille.
Both uncontracted and contracted braille input via a braille keyboard is also supported.
Please see the [Supported Braille Displays #SupportedBrailleDisplays] section for information about the supported braille displays.

NVDA supports braille codes for many languages, including contracted, uncontracted and computer braille codes.

The Voice Settings dialog box contains the following options:


==== Voice -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsVoice]}+
The first option that you land on in this dialog is a combo box listing all the voices of the current synthesizer that you have installed.
You can use the arrow keys to listen to all the various choices.
Left and Up arrow take you up in the list, while right and down arrow move you down in the list.


==== Variant -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsVariant]}+
If you are using the Espeak NG synthesizer that is packaged with NVDA, this is a combo box that lets you select the Variant the synthesizer should speak with.
ESpeak NG's Variants are rather like voices, as they provide slightly different attributes to the eSpeak NG voice.
Some variants will sound like a male, some like a female, and some even like a frog.


==== Rate -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsRate]}+
This option allows you to change the rate of your voice.
This is a slider that goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the slowest, 100 being the fastest).


==== Pitch -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsPitch]}+
This option allows you to change the pitch of the current voice.
It is a slider which goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the lowest pitch and 100 being the highest).


==== Volume -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsVolume]}+
This option is a slider which goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the lowest volume and 100 being the highest).


==== Inflection -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsInflection]}+
This option is a slider that lets you choose how much inflection (rise and fall in pitch) the synthesizer should use to speak with. (The only synthesizer that provides this option at the present time is eSpeak NG).


==== Automatic Language switching -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsLanguageSwitching]}+
This checkbox allows you to toggle whether NVDA should switch speech synthesizer languages automatically if the text being read specifies its language.
This option is enabled by default.
Currently only the eSpeak NG synthesizer supports automatic language switching.


==== Automatic Dialect switching -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsDialectSwitching]}+
This checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not dialect changes should be made, rather than just actual language changes.
For example, if reading in an English U.S. voice but a document specifies that some text is in English U.K., then the synthesizer will switch accents if this option is enabled.
This option is disabled by default.

%kc:setting

==== Punctuation/Symbol Level -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsSymbolLevel]}+
Key: NVDA+p

This allows you to choose the amount of punctuation and other symbols that should be spoken as words.
For example, when set to all, all symbols will be spoken as words.
This option applies to all synthesizers, not just the currently active synthesizer.


==== Trust voice's language for processing symbols and characters -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsTrust]}+
On by default, this option tells NVDA if the current voice's language can be trusted when processing symbols and characters.
If you find that NVDA is reading punctuation in the wrong language for a particular synthesizer or voice, you may wish to turn this off to force NVDA to use its global language setting instead.


==== Capital pitch change percentage -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsCapPitchChange]}+
This edit field allows you to type the amount that the pitch of the voice will change when speaking a capital letter.
This value is a percentage, where a negative value lowers the pitch and a positive value raises it.
For no pitch change you would use 0.


==== Say "cap" before capitals -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsSayCapBefore]}+
This setting is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to say the word "cap" before any capital letter when spoken as an individual character such as when spelling.
Usually, NVDA raises the pitch slightly for any capital letter, but some synthesizers may not support this well, so perhaps this option may be of use.


==== Beep for capitals -{====}- +{====[VoiceSettingsBeepForCaps]}+
If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will make a small beep each time it encounters a capitalized character by itself.
Like the "say cap for capitals" checkbox, this is useful for Synthesizers that can't change their pitch for capital letters.


==== Use spelling functionality if supported -{====[VoiceSpellingFunctionality]}- +{====[VoiceSettingsUseSpelling]}+
Some words consist of only one character, but the pronunciation is different depending on whether the character is being spoken as an individual character (such as when spelling) or a word.
For example, in English, "a" is both a letter and a word and is pronounced differently in each case.
This option allows the synthesizer to differentiate between these two cases if the synthesizer supports this.

However, for phonetic input methods such as Chinese New Phonetic, it may be more useful to turn this option off, as all the symbols will sound the same and you will have to use the arrow keys to navigate the list items individually to gain more information  from the character descriptions for each candidate.


==== Announce Selected Candidate -{====}- +{====[InputCompositionAnnounceSelectedCandidate]}+

For input methods where the selection can be changed with the arrow keys  (such as Chinese New Phonetic) this is necessary, but for some input methods it may be more efficient typing with this option turned off.
Note that even with this option off, the review cursor will still be placed on the selected candidate allowing you to use object navigation / review to manually read this or other candidates.


==== Always include short character descriptions for candidates -{====}- +{====[InputCompositionCandidateIncludesShortCharacterDescription]}+
This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should provide a short description for each character in a candidate, either when it's selected or when it's automatically read when the candidate list appears.
Note that for locales such as Chinese, the announcement of extra character descriptions for the selected candidate is not affected by this option.
This option may be useful for Korean and Japanese input methods.


==== Report changes to the reading string -{====}- +{====[InputCompositionReadingStringChanges]}+
Some input methods such as Chinese New Phonetic and New ChangJie have a reading string (sometimes known as a precomposition string).
You can choose whether or not NVDA should announce new characters being typed into this reading string with this option.
This option is on by default.
Note some older input methods such as Chinese ChangJie may not use the reading string to hold precomposition characters, but instead use the composition string directly. Please see the next option for configuring reporting of the composition string.


==== Report changes to the composition string -{====}- +{====[InputCompositionCompositionStringChanges]}+
After reading or precomposition data has been combined into a valid pictographic symbol, most input methods place this symbol into a composition string for temporary storage along with other combined symbols before they are finally inserted into the document.
