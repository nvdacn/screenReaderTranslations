 Using the temporary copy of NVDA is also an option (e.g. for demonstration purposes), though  starting NVDA in this way each time can become very time consuming.
 
+++ Portable and Temporary Copy Restrictions ++
+A part from the  inability to automatically start during and or after log-on, the portable and temporary copies of NVDA also have the following restrictions:
+ - The inability to interact with applications running with administrative privilidges, unless of course NVDA itself has been run also with these privilidges (not recommended).
+ - The inability to read User Account Control (UAC) screens when trying to start an application with administrative privilidges.
+ - Windows 8: the inability to support input from a touch screen.
+ - Windows 8: the inability to provide features such as browse mode and speaking of typed characters in Windows Store apps.

 ++ Installing NVDA ++
 If installing NVDA directly from the NVDA download package, press the Install NVDA button.
 If you have already closed this dialog or are wanting to install from a portable copy, please choose the Install NVDA menu item found under Tools in the NVDA menu.
