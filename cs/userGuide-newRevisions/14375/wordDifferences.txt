Both the ALVA BC640 and BC680 displays from [Optelec http://www.optelec.com/] are supported when connected via USB or bluetooth.
+{Alternatively, you can connect an older Optelec display, such as a Braille Voyager, using a protocol converter supplied by Optelec.}+
You do not need any specific drivers to be installed to use these displays.
Just plug in the display and configure NVDA to use it.

+{Note: NVDA might be unable to use an ALVA BC6 display over Bluetooth when it is paired using the ALVA Bluetooth utility.
When you have paired your device using this utility and NVDA is unable to detect your device, we recommend you to pair your ALVA display the regular way using the Windows Bluetooth settings.
