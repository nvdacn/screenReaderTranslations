  Merged win8Injection branch. This means that installed releases of NVDA can now hook into metro style apps, enabling features such as speaking typed characters, browse mode for web documents (including full support for metro version of Internet Explorer 10), and displayModel (if GDI is ever used). Please note that this will *only* work if NVDA runs with the uiAccess privilidge, which for now only is installed official releases (not snapshots or any portable copies).
  A lot of NVDA's rpc and injection code needed to be rewritten to handle metro style apps. Therefore please watch out for and report any weirdness resulting from this revision (especially on Operating Systems before Windows 8).
