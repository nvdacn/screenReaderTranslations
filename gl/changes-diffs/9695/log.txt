    Fixed an issue where the HumanWare Brailliant BI/B series braille display driver wasn't presented as an option in the Braille Settings dialog on some systems, even though such a display was connected via USB.
    
    It seems that there can be entries under the USB product key which don't have the Device Parameters\PortName value. Previously, this caused an exception which aborted the scan, skipping even Bluetooth devices.
