message:
  If NVDA must resort to a graphic or link's URL for a name if there is no title or alt, it will only be used if the resultant name remains shorter than 30 characters. Anything larger is assumed to be garbage and is replaced by a space. This should make reading web pages containing ad graphics and such much more enjoyable. Fixes #1989
