 == Bug Fixes ==
 - The quick navigation keys for jumping to the next or previous separator in Browse Mode now works in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls. (#2781)
 - If NVDA falls back to eSpeak or  no speech due to a configured speech synthesizer failing when NVDA starts, the configuration is no longer updated to set the fallback synthesizer as the configured choice, meaning that now the original synthesizer will be tried again next time NVDA starts. (#2589)
+- In browse mode in Mozilla applications, updates to tables are now rendered correctly. For example, in updated cells, row and column coordinates are reported and table navigation works as it should. (#2784)
