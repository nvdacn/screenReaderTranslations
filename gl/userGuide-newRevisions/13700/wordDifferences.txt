+ +{Content Recognition +
When authors don't provide sufficient information for a screen reader user to determine the content of something, various tools can be used to attempt to recognize the content from an image.
NVDA supports the optical character recognition (OCR) functionality built into Windows 10 to recognize text from images.
Additional content recognizers can be provided in NVDA add-ons.

When you use a content recognition command, NVDA recognizes content from the current [navigator object #ObjectNavigation].
By default, the navigator object follows the system focus or browse mode cursor, so you can usually just move the focus or browse mode cursor where desired.
For example, if you move the browse mode cursor to a graphic, recognition will recognize content from the graphic by default.
However, you may wish to use object navigation directly to, for example, recognize the content of an entire application window.

Once recognition is complete, the result will be presented in a document similar to browse mode, allowing you to read the information with cursor keys, etc.
Pressing enter or space will activate (normally click) the text at the cursor if possible.
Pressing escape dismisses the recognition result.

++ Windows 10 OCR ++[Win10Ocr]
Windows 10 includes OCR for many languages.
NVDA can use this to recognize text from images or inaccessible applications.

You can set the language to use for text recognition in the [Windows 10 OCR #Win10OcrSettings] settings dialog.
Additional languages can be installed by opening the Start menu, choosing Settings, selecting Time & Language -> Region & Language and then choosing Add a language.
