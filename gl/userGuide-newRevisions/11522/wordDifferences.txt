+ Application Specific -{NVDA Commands}- +{Features}+ +
NVDA provides its own extra -{commands}- +{features}+  for some applications to make certain tasks easier or to provide access to functionality which is not otherwise accessible to screen reader users.

++ Microsoft Word ++

Secondly, NVDA needs to know which row or column contains the headers in any given table.
After moving to the first cell in the column or row containing the headers, use one of the following commands:}+
