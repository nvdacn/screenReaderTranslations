    Fixed problems with braille display output when entering Korean characters.
    
    NVDAHelper.handleInputCompositionStart: the new input composition NVDAObject's parent is set to the most correct focus (i.e. objectWithFocus). However, if this is equal to NVDA's focus object, use that instead, in order to still maintain any possible state.
    Fixes #5640.
