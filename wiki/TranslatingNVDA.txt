= NVDA translation and localization =

Thank you for considering to localize NVDA to your language, or improveing an existing translation.
In order to support multiple languages/locales, NVDA must be translated and data specific to the locale must be provided.
There are several things to be done, and this document hopes to give you an overview and guide you through the process.

== Translation mailing list ==

You can subscribe to NVDA translations mailing list [here http://www.freelists.org/list/nvda-translations]
Thanks to Freelists.org

It is an English low trafic list devoted for the discussion of translation. 
Important messages that relate to translators will also be sent here, 
i.e. before nvda official releases, to remind translators to make sure 
their localization is up to date.
As a translator, you no longer need to follow the NVDA dev mailing list.

== New localization ==
Start by subscribing to the translation list above, so that you can get help and advice.

It is recommended that you use our new more automated workflow, which
will allow you to focus only on translation, see automated workflow section below.

If you still wish to go through the manual process, then follow the
instructions on the TranslatingUsingManualProcess page. 
Also look at the files to be localized section below.

== Improving an existing localization ==

You should contact the existing maintainer of your language, and
discuss your suggestions and changes. Together you should be able to
agree on the best translation and terms to be used, and the neccessary
changes can be made.

You can find their contact information in the list of contributers, or
you can send an email to the 
[wiki:Development#Developmentemaillist Developer mailing list] or
[wiki:Development#Translationemaillist translation mailing list]
to see if they are current list members.

If your language is no longer maintained, you can request to be the new maintainer for the language.

== Files to be localized ==

These files are listed in order of importance.

- nvda.po, NVDA's interface messages, see TranslatingTheInterface page for more info.
- characterDescriptions.dic, names of characters in your language, see TranslatingCharacterDescriptions for more info.
- symbols.dic, names of symbols and punctuation in your language, see TranslatingSymbols for more information.
- langstrings.txt, the installer interface, see TranslatingLangstrings for more information.
- userGuide.t2t, the userguide, see TranslatingUserGuide for more information.
- changes.t2t (optional), a list of changes between releases, see TranslatingChanges for more information.

== Advantages of the automatic workflow process ==

- No need of a full nvda bzr setup.
- You will be sent an email or twitter message when your po file needs updating.
- You will be sent an email or twitter message when your userGuide or changes file needs to
be updated.
- Automatic generation of html from t2t files, so that you can check 
the correctness of your t2t markup.
- Automatically generated diff and word diff between previous and new 
version, to help you quickly finding the changes.
- A higher quality userGuide since the diffs encourage you to keep the 
english and your localization closely updated.
- Translation becomes many small tasks instead a big rush near a 
deadline. Maybe 10 minutes per week on average.
- It is easier to contribute, since each work unit is self contained.
- Your translation is regularly submitted to be included into nvda snapshots.
- Instead of following nvda dev mailing list emails, you can just 
subscribe to nvda translations and important messages related to 
translation will be sent there.
- Auto generated Statistics between the English and your localized user guide, to quickly spot missing paragraphs, tables and lists.
- Automatic checking of po files, making sure that there are no mistakes that could cause any errors.
-

Please feel free to update this or any subsequent page with any tips or hints that you
feel may be of use to other translators.
