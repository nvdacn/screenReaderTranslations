= Translating the interface nvda.po =

It is recommended that you use !PoEdit, since it will ensure that the file is saved correctly, and is correctly formatted.

== !PoEdit ==

=== Installing and running !PoEdit ===

!PoEdit's homepage is: http://www.poedit.net/

You can always download the latest Windows !PoEdit version at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/files/

Install it by following the on-screen instructions, the default options should be sufficient.

When you run !PoEdit for the first time, the first screen is where you choose the default !PoEdit interface language, this is the language for the program menus, windows and options. It probably will default to your system language. In what follows, we will refer to !PoEdit menus and options by their English names.

The next step is to enter your name and e-mail for !PoEdit 
which will be included in the strings catalog file (nvda.po), to identify you as the last translator.
It is now ok to close the preferences window, the default values for the other options are fine.

=== Translating using !PoEdit ===

Assuming you went through the initial steps above, and you have now opened nvda.po using poedit, 
you will be placed on a list with all of NVDA's interface messages.

You can read the status bar to see how many strings have already been
translated, the number of untranslated messages, and how many are
fuzzy. A fuzzy string is a message which has been automatically
translated, thus it may be wrong. To insert or correct the translation
for a string, first select it with the arrows, then tab to the blank
edit field and type its translation.

You may want to spell the original string to be aware of any
punctuation mark, capital letters, etc. !PoEdit has a keystroke you
may press while on an original string, alt+C, that copies the original
string to the edit field when pressed. You may then replace it with
your translation as normal.

Press control+s at any moment to save your work. Each time you press
this key, !PoEdit saves NVDA.po and also re-compiles NVDA.mo.

If you dont have the !PoEdit appmodule, you may find it useful, you
can find it here #1811

== Translating using a text editor ==

nvda.po is a plain text file which contains all
of the specified strings to be translated.

Each line beginning with "msgid" contains an original English message
surrounded by quotes. Each line beginning with "msgstr" contains empty
quotes which should be filled in with the translation that corresponds
to the original English message at the above line or lines.  You
should also fill in the first lines of the file, which hold the
program's title, author, translator, language, etc.

In addition, don't forget to specify UTF-8 in the charset field and
8bit in the Content-Transfer-Encoding field.

== Messages with formatting strings ==

You will come across several messages that have additional characters
or punctuation as part of the message, this section will explain how
they should be treated.

- %d, digits
- %s, string
- %.2f, a number to 2 digits after the comma, for example 5.25
- {keyword}, the text around the keyword should be translated, but the word should be left as is.
-


=== Examples ===
{{{%d percent}}}

this means that {{{%d}}} will be replaced by a number when the program
is running, and you only need to translate the word {{{percent}}}.

{{{subject: %s}}}
here {{{%s}}} means that another string will be substituted.

{{{on \{backgroundColor\} }}}

In this case, the word on should be translated, and the rest should be left alone.
This will be presented as "black on white", "yellow on black", etc.

== messages with ampersands ==

{{{&Rate}}}

The letter following the ampersand sign can be used as a mnemonic
(shortcut key).  So when you translate, you can put the ampersand
wherever in the translated message, and the letter that follows it
will be used as the shortcut for your language.  When you have
completed all other translation work, you may want to review the
mnemonics, since they provide many users a fast way of jumping to
particular items in dialogs, such as specific checkboxes or combo
boxes.
