= Manual translation process == 

Note: to fill in edit fields, save files, and create folders as
explained later, you must be careful about case sensitivity.

You are expected to have the NVDA's source code version installed and
working fine on your machine. You can visit the
AccessingAndRunningSourceCode page for more information.

For these instructions, It is assumed you have Python 2.7 installed in
c:\python27, and NVDA's source files installed in c:\NVDA\source.

== nvda.po ==

Download the latest pot file from the Snapshots page.

For a new language, rename the file to nvda.po and proceed to reading
the information on the TranslatingTheInterface page.

To update your existing localization, 
merge the pot file downloaded above with your existing nvda.po using the following steps.

Download msgmerge.py from:
http://www.jantrid.net/misc_files/msgmerge.py and Place it in any
directory. Here it has been placed into \python27\tools\i18n.

Then go to a command prompt, change to the source directory and type:
{{{ \python27\tools\i18n\msgmerge.py -U nvda.po nvda.pot }}}
You may like to create a batch file including these commands to speed up this process.

This will update the translated nvda.po with the new messages from
nvda.pot which are not translated. You can now proceed to the
TranslatingTheInterface page.

== Testing your localization ==

In nvda\source\locale Create a new directory, The name of this new
directory should be the iso 639-2 code for your language e.g. de,
en, fr, it. If the language is used in various countries and you would
like to specify the specific dialect, then you can append an
underscore and a country code E.G. pt_BR, pt_PT, es_ES etc. You can
look up your language code
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes here] if you are
not sure.

Inside this new xx_XX directory, create another one called "LC_MESSAGES" and place the nvda.mo into it.


go to the user interface settings and
change the language. You will be asked to restart NVDA. Alternatively
you can edit nvda.ini within the source directory, search for the line
beginning with "language", and change the language letters from "enu"
to the language code of your translation.

To run NVDA in your language, start the nvda.pyw and select your
language from the language combo box in the General settings dialog,
NVDA should now present your localized messages.
