    NVDA no longer crashes when restarting after removing or updating an add-on which imports speechDictHandler in its installTasks module.
    
    This was due to a circular import between speechDictHandler and synthDriverHandler. speechDictHandler no longer requires synthDriverHandler, so that import was simply removed.
    Fixes #4496.
