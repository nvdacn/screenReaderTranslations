"NVDA is an international effort and there are users around the world.  A "
"number of mailing lists (both international and language specific) exists so "
"you can meet other NVDA users around the world, ask questions and help other "
"users.  If you know some English, we recommend joining the international "
"lists, since it is more likely that you will get a quicker answer.  If you "
"join your local mailing list, you can ask your questions and any reply will "
"be in your language.  You are more likely to find people living near you who "
"can meet you in person or talk with you over the phone to help you get "
"started with NVDA."
