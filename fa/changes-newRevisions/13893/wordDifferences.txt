== Changes for Developers ==
- "scons tests" now checks that translatable strings have translator comments. You can also run this alone with "scons checkPot". (#7492)
+{- There is now a new extensionPoints module which provides a generic framework to enable code extensibility at specific points in the code. This allows interested parties to register to be notified when some action occurs (extensionPoints.Action), to modify a specific kind of data (extensionPoints.Filter) or to participate in deciding whether something will be done (extensionPoints.Decider). (#3393)
- You can now register to be notified about configuration profile switches via the config.configProfileSwitched Action. (#3393)}+
