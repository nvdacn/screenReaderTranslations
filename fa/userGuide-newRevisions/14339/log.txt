    Add the ability to automatically tether to focus or review (#7489)
    
    * Add support for auto tethering to NVDA
    
    * Use extensionPoints.callWithSupportedKwargs as a fallback for executing event handlers, to support executing events with undefined kwargs.
    
    * Pass an additional parameter for becomeNavigatorObject (isFocus)
    
    * Some small comma fixes and default params are now correct
    
    * Make sure caret moves properly update the braille display when it was tethered to review before
    
    * Some more logging in eventHandler
    
    * More review actions regarding UX
    
    * Update user guide
    
    * DO not update the review position when a tether to focus is expected due to the review move being caused by a focus or caret change
    
    * Fix failing cursor manager test
    
    * Deal with auto tethering in the braille to focus script
    
    * fix braille_toFocus in such a way that it also goes back to focus when reviewing a terminal
    
    * Fix cases where tethering to review and back to focus in browse mode would result in the caret not being followed correctly. This also applies to the braille_toFocus script
    
    * No longer handleGainFocus when tethered to review, and no longer handleReviewMove when tethered to focus
