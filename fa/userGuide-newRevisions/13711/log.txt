    Separate braille cursor shapes for focus and review (PR #7180)
    
    Fixes #7122
    Split braille cursor shape into separate shapes for focus and review.
    
    This makes it easier to distinguish between the two.
    The default for focus remains dots 7 and 8, with only dot 8 for review.
