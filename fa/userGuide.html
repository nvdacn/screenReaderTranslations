<H3> ٢.١. Internationalization</H3>

<P>
It is important that people anywhere in the world, no matter what language they speak, get equal access to technology.
Besides English, NVDA has been translated into 44 languages including: Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Aragonese, Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Farsi, Finnish, French, Galician, Greek, Georgian, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Nepali, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Thai, Traditional and Simplified Chinese, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese.
</P>

<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H3> ٣.١. Speech Synthesizer Support</H3>

<P>
Apart from providing its messages and interface in several languages, NVDA can also enable the user to read content in any language, as long as they have a speech synthesizer that can speak that language.
</P>
<P>
NVDA is bundled with <A HREF="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</A>, a free, open-source, multi-lingual speech synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
Information about other speech synthesizers that NVDA supports can be found in the <A HREF="#SupportedSpeechSynths">Supported Speech Synthesizers</A> section.
</P>

<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H3> ٤.١. Braille support</H3>

<P>
For users that own a refreshable braille display, NVDA can output its information in Braille.
Please see the <A HREF="#SupportedBrailleDisplays">Supported Braille Displays</A> section for information about the supported braille displays.
</P>
<P>
NVDA supports braille codes for many languages, including contracted, uncontracted and computer braille codes for many languages.
</P>

<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H3> ٥.١. Licence and Copyright</H3>

<P>
NVDA is copyright 2006-2013 NVDA contributors.

</P>

<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H2> ٢. System Requirements</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Operating Systems: all 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 (including Server operating Systems)
<LI>Memory: 256 mb or more of RAM
<LI>Processor speed: 1.0 ghz or above
<LI>About 50 MB of storage space.
</UL>

<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H2> ٣. Getting and Setting Up NVDA</H2>

<P>
If you have not yet got a copy of NVDA, you can download it from <A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/">www.nvda-project.org</A>.
</P>
<P>
Go to the download section and you will find a link to download the latest version of NVDA.
</P>
<P>
Running the file you have just downloaded will start a temporary copy of NVDA.
You will then be asked if you want to install NVDA, create a portable copy or just continue using the temporary copy.
</P>
<P>
If you plan to  always use NVDA on this computer, you will want to choose to install NVDA.
Installing NVDA will allow for additional functionality such as automatic starting after logon, the ability to read the Windows Logon and Windows security screens (which cannot be done with portable and temporary copies) and creation of Start Menu and desktop shortcuts.
The installed copy is also able to create a portable copy itself at any time.
</P>
<P>
If you want to take NVDA with you on a USB thum drive or other writable  media, then you  should choose to create a portable copy.
The portable copy also has the ability to install itself on any computer at a later time.
However, if you wish to copy NVDA onto read-only media such as a CD, you should just copy the download package.
Running the portable version directly from read-only media is not supported at this time.
</P>
<P>
Using the temporary copy of NVDA is also an option (e.g. for demonstration purposes), though  starting NVDA in this way each time can become very time consuming.
</P>

<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<H3> ١.٣. Portable and Temporary Copy Restrictions</H3>

<P>
Apart from the  inability to automatically start during and or after log-on, the portable and temporary copies of NVDA also have the following restrictions:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The inability to interact with applications running with administrative privileges, unless of course NVDA itself has been run also with these privileges (not recommended).
<LI>The inability to read User Account Control (UAC) screens when trying to start an application with administrative privileges.
<LI>Windows 8: the inability to support input from a touch screen.
<LI>Windows 8: the inability to provide features such as browse mode and speaking of typed characters in Windows Store apps.
</UL>

<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<H3> ٢.٣. Installing NVDA</H3>

<P>
If installing NVDA directly from the NVDA download package, press the Install NVDA button.
If you have already closed this dialog or are wanting to install from a portable copy, please choose the Install NVDA menu item found under Tools in the NVDA menu.
</P>
<P>
The installation dialog that appears will confirm whether you wish to install NVDA and will also tell you whether  this installation will be updating a previous install.
Pressing the Continue button will start installing NVDA.
There are also a few options in this dialog which are explained below.
Once the installation has completed, a message will appear telling you that it was successful.
Pressing OK at this point will restart the newly installed copy of NVDA.
</P>

<A NAME="toc12"></A>
<H4> ١.٢.٣. Start at Windows Logon</H4>

<P>
This option allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should automatically start while on the Windows Logon screen, before you have entered a password.
This also includes UAC control and other secure screens.
</P>

<A NAME="toc13"></A>
<H4> ٢.٢.٣. Create Desktop Shortcut (ctrl+alt+n)</H4>

<P>
This option allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should create a shortcut on the desktop to start NVDA. 
This shortcut if created will also be assigned a  shortcut key of control+alt+n allowing you to start NVDA at any time with this key stroke.
</P>

<A NAME="toc14"></A>
<H4> ٣.٢.٣. Copy Portable Configuration to Current User Account</H4>

<P>
This option allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should copy the user configuration from the currently running NVDA into the configuration for the currently logged on  user, for the installed copy of NVDA. 
This will not  copy the configuration for   any other users  of this system nor to the system configuration for use at Windows Logon and other secure screens.
This option is only available when installing from a portable copy, not when installing directly from the downloaded Launcher package.
</P>

<A NAME="toc15"></A>
<H3> ٣.٣. Creating a Portable Copy</H3>

<P>
If creating a portable copy directly from the NVDA download  package, simply press the Create Portable Copy button.
If you have already closed this dialog or you are running an installed copy of NVDA, choose the Create Portable copy menu item found under Tools in the NVDA menu.
</P>
<P>
The Dialog that appears allows you to choose where the portable copy should be created.
This can be a directory on your hard drive or a location on a USB thum drive or other portable media.
There is also an option to choose whether NVDA should copy the logged on user's current NVDA configuration for use  with the newly created portable copy.
 This option is only available when creating a portable copy from an installed copy, not when creating from the download package.
Pressing Continue will create the portable copy.
Once creation is complete, a message will appear telling you it was successfull.
Press OK to dismiss this dialog.
</P>

<A NAME="toc16"></A>
<H2> ٤. Getting started with NVDA</H2>

<A NAME="toc17"></A>
<H3> ١.٤. Launching NVDA</H3>

<P>
If you have installed NVDA with the installer, then starting NVDA is as simple as either pressing control+alt+n, or choosing NVDA from the NVDA menu under Programs on the Start Menu.
Additionally you can type NVDA into the Run dialog and press Enter.
</P>
<P>
To start the portable version, go to the directory you unpacked NVDA to, and press enter or double click on nvda.exe.
</P>
<P>
As NVDA starts, you will first hear an ascending set of tones (telling you that NVDA is loading).
Depending on how fast your computer is, or if you are running NVDA off a USB key or other slower medium, it may take a little while to start.
If it is taking an extra long time, NVDA should say "Loading NVDA. Please wait..."
</P>
<P>
If you don't hear any of this, or you hear the Windows error sound, or a descending set of tones, then this means that NVDA has an error, and you will need to possibly report a bug to the developers.
Please check out the NVDA website for how to do this.
</P>
<P>
When NVDA starts for the first time, you will be greeted by a dialog box which provides you with some basic information about the NVDA modifier key and the NVDA menu.
(Please see further sections about these topics.)
The dialog box also contains three checkboxes.
The first lets you control if NVDA should use the capslock as an NVDA modifier key.
The second specifies whether NVDA should start automatically after you log on to Windows and is only available for installed copies of NVDA.
The third lets you control if this Welcome dialog should appear each time NVDA starts.
</P>

<A NAME="toc18"></A>
<H3> ٢.٤. About NVDA keyboard commands</H3>

<A NAME="toc19"></A>
<H4> ١.٢.٤. The NVDA Modifier Key</H4>

<P>
Most NVDA-specific keyboard commands usually consist of pressing a particular key called the NVDA modifier key, in conjunction with one or more other keys.
An exception to this are the text review commands which just use the numpad keys by themselves.
</P>
<P>
NVDA can be configured so that either the numpad Insert, Extended Insert, or capslock key can be used as the NVDA modifier key.
</P>
<P>
By default, both the numpad Insert and Extended Insert keys are set as NVDA modifier keys.
</P>
<P>
If you wish to cause one of the NVDA modifier keys to act like its original key (for instance you wish to turn capslock on when you have set capslock to be an NVDA modifier key) you can press the key twice in quick succession.
</P>

<A NAME="toc20"></A>
<H4> ٢.٢.٤. Keyboard Layouts</H4>

<P>
NVDA currently comes with two sets of key commands.
There is a layout for Desktops and a layout for Laptops.
NVDA by default is set to use the Desktop layout, though you can switch to the Laptop layout in the Keyboard Settings, found under Preferences in the NVDA menu.
</P>
<P>
The Desktop layout makes heavy use of the numberpad (with numlock off).
Although most laptops do not have a physical numberpad, some laptops can emulate one by holding down the FN key and pressing letters and numbers on the right-hand side of the keyboard (7 8 9 u i o j k l etc).
If your laptop can not do this, or does not allow you to turn numlock off, you may want to switch to the Laptop layout instead.
</P>

<A NAME="toc21"></A>
<H3> ٣.٤. NVDA Touch Gestures</H3>

<P>
If you are running NVDA on a device with a touch screen and running Windows 8 or higher, you can also control NVDA directly via the touch screen.
While NVDA is running, all touch input will go directly to NVDA. 
Therefore, actions that can be performed normally without NVDA will not work.
</P>

<A NAME="toc22"></A>
<H4> ١.٣.٤. Exploring the Screen</H4>

<P>
The most basic action you can perform with the touch screen is to announce the control or text at any point on the screen.
To do this, place one finger anywhere on the screen.
You can also keep your finger on the screen and move it around to read other controls and text that your finger moves over.
</P>

<A NAME="toc23"></A>
<H4> ٢.٣.٤. Touch Gestures</H4>

<P>
When NVDA commands are described later in this user guide, they may list a touch gesture which can be used to activate that command with the touch screen.
Following are some instructions on how to perform the various touch gestures.
</P>

<H5>Taps</H5>

<P>
Tap the screen quickly with one or more fingers.
</P>
<P>
Tapping once with one  finger is simpley known as a tap.
Tapping with 2 fingers at the same time is a 2-finger tap and so on.
</P>
<P>
If the same tap is performed one or more times again in quick succession, NVDA will instead treat this as a multi-tap gesture.
Tapping twice will result in a double tap.
Tapping 3 times will result in a triple tap and so on.
Of course, these multi-tap gestures also recognize how many fingers were used, so it's possible to have gestures like a 2-finger triple tap, a 4-finger tap, etc. 
</P>

<H5>Flicks</H5>

<P>
Quickly swipe your finger across the screen.
</P>
<P>
There are 4 possible flick gestures depending on the direction: flick left, flick right, flick up and flick down.
</P>
<P>
Just like taps, more than one finger can be used to perform the gesture.
Therefore, gestures such as 2-finger flick up and 4-finger flick left are all possible.
</P>

<A NAME="toc24"></A>
<H4> ٣.٣.٤. Touch Modes</H4>

<P>
As there are many more NVDA commands than possible touch gestures, NVDA has several touch modes you can switch between which make certain subsets of commands available.
The two modes are text mode and object mode. 
Certain NVDA commands listed in this document may have a touch mode listed in brackets after the touch gesture.
For example, flick up (text mode) means that the command will be performed if you flick up, but only while in text mode.
If the command does not have a mode listed, it will work in any mode.
</P>
<P>
To toggle touch modes, perform a 3-finger tap.
</P>

<A NAME="toc25"></A>
<H3> ٤.٤. Input Help Mode</H3>

<P>
Many NVDA commands are mentioned throughout the rest of this user guide, but an easy way to explore all the different commands is to turn on input help.
</P>
<P>
To turn on input help, press NVDA+1.
To turn it off, press NVDA+1 again.

<H2> ٥. Navigating with NVDA</H2>

<P>
NVDA allows you to explore and navigate the system in several ways, including both normal interaction and review.
</P>

<A NAME="Objects"></A>
<H3> ١.٥. Objects</H3>

<P>
Each Application and the operating system itself consist of many objects.
An object is a single item such as a piece of text, button, checkbox, slider, list or editable text field.
</P>

<A NAME="SystemFocus"></A>
<H3> ٢.٥. Navigating with the System Focus</H3>

<P>
The system focus, also known simply as the focus, is the <A HREF="#Objects">object</A> which receives keys typed on the keyboard.
For example, if you are typing into an editable text field, the editable text field has the focus.
</P>
<P>
The Most common way of navigating around Windows with NVDA is to simply move the system focus using standard Windows keyboard commands, such as pressing tab and shift+tab to move forward and back between controls, pressing alt to get to the menu bar and then using the arrows to navigate menus, and using alt+tab to move between running applications.
As you do this, NVDA will report information about the object with focus, such as its name, type, value, state, description, keyboard shortcut and positional information.
</P>
<P>
There are some key commands that are useful when moving with the System focus:
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Report title</TD>
<TD>NVDA+t</TD>
<TD>NVDA+t</TD>
<TD>Reports the title of the currently active window. Pressing twice will spell the information. Pressing three times will copy it to the clipboard</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Read active window</TD>
<TD>NVDA+b</TD>
<TD>NVDA+b</TD>
<TD>reads all the controls in the currently active window (useful for dialogs)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Report Status Bar</TD>
<TD>NVDA+end</TD>
<TD>NVDA+shift+end</TD>
<TD>Reports the Status Bar if NVDA finds one. It also moves the navigator object to this location</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="SystemCaret"></A>
<H3> ٣.٥. Navigating with the System Caret</H3>

<P>
When an <A HREF="#Objects">object</A> that allows navigation and/or editing of text is <A HREF="#SystemFocus">focused</A>, you can move through the text using the system caret, also known as the edit cursor.
</P>
<P>
When the focus is on an object that has the system caret, you can use the arrow keys, page up, page down, home, end, etc. to move through the text.
You can also change the text if the control supports editing.
NVDA will announce as you move by character, word and line, and will also announce as you select and unselect text.
</P>
<P>
NVDA provides the following key commands in relation to the system caret:
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">

</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="toc33"></A>
<H3> ٤.٥. Object Navigation</H3>

<P>
Most of the time, you will work with applications using commands which move the <A HREF="#SystemFocus">focus</A> and the <A HREF="#SystemCaret">caret</A>.
However, sometimes, you may wish to explore the current application or the Operating System without moving the focus or caret.
You may also wish to work with <A HREF="#Objects">objects</A> that cannot be accessed normally using the keyboard.
In these cases, you can use object navigation.
</P>
<P>
Object navigation allows you to move between and obtain information about individual <A HREF="#Objects">objects</A>.
When you move to an object, NVDA will report it similarly to the way it reports the system focus.
For a way to review all text as it appears on the screen, you can instead use <A HREF="#ScreenReview">screen review</A>.
</P>
<P>
Rather than having to move back and forth between every single object on the system, the objects are organized hierarchically.
This means that some objects contain other objects and you must move inside them to access the objects they contain.
For example, a list contains list items, so you must move inside the list in order to access its items.
If you have moved to a list item, moving next and previous will take you to other list items in the same list.
Moving to a list item's containing object will take you back to the list.
You can then move past the list if you wish to access other objects.
Similarly, a toolbar contains controls, so you must move inside the toolbar to access the controls in the toolbar.
</P>
<P>
The object currently being reviewed is called the navigator object.
Once you navigate to an object, you can review its content using the <A HREF="#ReviewingText">text review commands</A> while in <A HREF="#ObjectReview">Object review mode</A>.
By default, the navigator object moves along with the System focus, though this behaviour can be toggled on and off.
</P>
<P>
Note that braille follows the <A HREF="#SystemFocus">focus</A> and <A HREF="#SystemCaret">caret</A> by default, rather than object navigation and text review.
If you want it to follow object navigation and text review instead, you need to <A HREF="#BrailleTether">configure braille to be tethered to</A> review.
</P>
<P>
To navigate by object, use the following commands:

Note: numpad keys require numlock key to be turned off to work properly.
</P>

<A NAME="ReviewingText"></A>
<H3> ٥.٥. Reviewing Text</H3>

<P>
NVDA allows you to read the contents of the <A HREF="#ScreenReview">screen</A>, current <A HREF="#DocumentReview">document</A> or current <A HREF="#ObjectReview">object</A> by character, word or line.
This is mostly useful in places (including Windows command consoles) where there is no <A HREF="#SystemCaret">system caret</A>.
For example, you might use it to review the text of a long information message in a dialog.
</P>
<P>
When moving the review cursor, the System caret does not follow along, so you can review text without losing your editing position.
However, by default, when the System caret moves, the review cursor follows along.
This can be toggled on and off.
</P>
<P>
Note that braille follows the <A HREF="#SystemFocus">focus</A> and <A HREF="#SystemCaret">caret</A> by default, rather than object navigation and text review.
If you want it to follow object navigation and text review instead, you need to <A HREF="#BrailleTether">configure braille to be tethered to</A> review.

A good way to remember the basic text review commands  when using the Desktop layout  is to think of them as being in a grid of three by three, with top to bottom being line, word and character and left to right being previous, current and next.

<H3> ٦.٥. Review Modes</H3>

<P>
NVDA's <A HREF="#ReviewingText">text review commands</A> can review content within the current navigator object, current document or screen, depending on the review mode selected.
Review modes are a replacement for the older Flat Review concept found in NVDA.
</P>
<P>
The following commands switch between review modes:

</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="ObjectReview"></A>
<H4> ١.٦.٥. Object Review</H4>

<P>
While in object review mode, you are able to only review the content of the current <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A>.
For objects such as editable text fields or other basic text controls, this will generally be the text content.
For other objects, this may be the name and/or value.
</P>

<A NAME="DocumentReview"></A>
<H4> ٢.٦.٥. Document Review</H4>

<P>
When the <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A> is within a browse mode document (e.g. web page) or other complex document (e.g. a Lotus Symphony document), it is possible to switch to the document review mode.
The document review mode allows you to review the text of the entire document.
</P>
<P>
When switching from object review to document review, the review cursor is placed in the document at the position of the navigator object.
When moving around the document with review commands, the navigator object is automatically updated to the object found at the current review cursor position.
</P>
<P>
Note that NVDA will switch to document review from object review automatically when moving around browse mode documents.
</P>

<A NAME="ScreenReview"></A>
<H4> ٣.٦.٥. Screen Review</H4>

<P>
The screen review mode allows you to review the text of the screen as it appears visually within the current application.
This is similar to the screen review or mouse cursor functionality in many other Windows screen readers.
</P>
<P>
When switching to screen review mode, the review cursor is placed at the screen position of the current <A HREF="#ObjectNavigation">navigator object</A>.
When moving around the screen with review commands, the navigator object is automatically updated to the object found at the screen position of the review cursor.
</P>
<P>
Note that in some newer applications, NVDA may not see some or all text displayed on the screen due to the use of newer screen drawing technologies which are impossible to support at this time.
</P>

<A NAME="toc39"></A>
<H3> ٧.٥. Navigating with the Mouse</H3>

<P>
When you move the Mouse, NVDA by default reports the text that is directly under the mouse pointer as the pointer moves over it.
Where supported, NVDA will read the surrounding paragraph of text, though some controls may only read by line.
</P>
<P>
NVDA can be configured to also announce the type of <A HREF="#Objects">object</A> under the mouse as it moves (e.g. list, button, etc.).
This may be useful for totally blind users, as sometimes, the text isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
NVDA provides a way for users to understand where the mouse is located relative to the dimensions of the screen by playing the current mouse coordinates as audio beeps.
The higher the mouse is on the screen, the higher the pitch of the beeps.
The further left or right the mouse is located on the screen, the further left or right the sound will be played (assuming the user has stereo speakers or headphones).
</P>
<P>
These extra mouse features are not turned on by default in NVDA.
If you wish to take advantage of them, you can configure them from the <A HREF="#MouseSettings">Mouse settings</A> dialog, found in the NVDA Preferences menu.
</P>
<P>
Although a physical mouse or trackpad should be used to navigate with the mouse, NVDA has a few key commands related to the mouse:

<H2> ٦. Browse Mode</H2>

<P>
Complex read-only documents such as web pages are browsed in NVDA using browse mode.
This includes documents in Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash.
</P>
<P>
In browse mode, the content of the document is made available in a flat representation that can be navigated with the cursor keys as if it were a normal text document.
All of NVDA's <A HREF="#SystemCaret">system caret</A> key commands will work in this mode; e.g. say all, report formatting, table navigation commands, etc.
Information such as whether text is a link, heading, etc. is reported along with the text as you move.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, you will need to interact directly with controls in these documents.
For example, you will need to do this for editable text fields and lists so that you can type characters and use the cursor keys to work with the control.
You do this by switching to focus mode, where almost all keys are passed to the control.
When in Browse mode, by default, NVDA will automatically switch to focus mode if you tab to or click on a particular control that requires it.
Conversely, tabbing to or clicking on a control that does not require focus mode will switch back to browse mode.
You can also press enter or space to switch to focus mode on controls that require it.
Pressing escape will switch back to browse mode.
In addition, you can manually force focus mode, after which it will remain in effect until you choose to disable it.

Some settings can also be changed using shortcut keys, which are listed where relevant in the sections below.
</P>

<A NAME="toc52"></A>
<H4> ١.١.٨. General Settings (NVDA+control+g)</H4>

<P>
The General settings dialog box is found in the Preferences menu.
It contains the following options:
</P>

<H5>Language</H5>

<P>
A combo box which allows you to select the language that NVDA's user interface and messages should be shown in.
There are many languages, however the default option is "User Default, Windows".
This option tells NVDA to use the language that Windows is currently set to.
</P>
<P>
Please note that NVDA must be restarted when changing the language.
NVDA will ask you if you wish to restart if you do change the selection.
Press OK, and NVDA will restart.
</P>

<H5>Save Configuration on Exit</H5>

<P>
This option is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to automatically save the current configuration when you exit NVDA.
</P>

<H5>Warn before exiting NVDA</H5>

<P>
This option is a checkbox that allows you to choose whether or not a dialog appears when you exit NVDA that asks whether or not you would like to exit.
When checked, a dialog will appear when you attempt to exit NVDA asking whether or not you want to exit.
</P>

<H5>Logging level</H5>

<P>
This is a combo box that permits you to choose how much NVDA will log as it's running.
Generally users should not need to touch this as not too much is logged.
However if you are wanting to provide information in a bug report, then it may be a useful option.
</P>

<H5>Automatically start NVDA after I log on to Windows</H5>

<P>
If this option is enabled, NVDA will start automatically as soon as you log on to Windows.
This option is only available for installed copies of NVDA.
</P>

<H5>Use NVDA on the windows Logon screen (requires administrative privileges)</H5>

<P>
If you log on to Windows by providing a user name and password, then enabling this option will make NVDA start automatically at the logon screen when Windows starts.
This option is only available for installed copies of NVDA.
</P>

<H5>Use currently saved settings on the logon and other secure screens</H5>

<P>
Pressing this button copies your currently saved NVDA user configuration to NVDA's system configuration directory, so that NVDA will use it when running on the logon, User Account Control (UAC) and other secure Windows screens.
To make sure that all your settings are transfered, make sure to firstly save your configuration with control+NVDA+c or save configuration in the NVDA menu.
This option is only available for installed copies of NVDA.
</P>

<H5>Automatically check for updates to NVDA</H5>

<P>
If this is enabled, NVDA will automatically check for updated versions of NVDA and inform you when an update is available.
You can also manually check for updates by selecting Check for updates under Help in the NVDA menu.
</P>

<A NAME="toc53"></A>
<H4> ٢.١.٨. Synthesizer Selection (NVDA+control+s)</H4>

<P>
The Synthesizer dialog, which is found under "Synthesizer..." in the Preferences menu, allows you to select which Synthesizer NVDA should use to speak with.
Once you have selected your synthesizer of choice, you can press Ok and NVDA will load the selected Synthesizer.
If there is an error loading the synthesizer, NVDA will notify you with a message, and continue using the previous synthesizer.
</P>

<H5>Synthesizer</H5>

<P>
This option allows you to choose the synthesizer you wish NVDA to use for speech output.
</P>
<P>
For a list of the Synthesizers that NVDA supports, please see the <A HREF="#SupportedSpeechSynths">Supported Speech Synthesizers</A> section.
</P>
<P>
One special item that will always appear in this list is "No speech", which allows you to use NVDA with no speech output what so ever.
This may be useful for someone who wishes to only use NVDA with Braille, or perhaps to sighted developers who only wish to use the Speech Viewer.
</P>

<H5>Output device</H5>

<P>
This option allows you to choose the sound card that NVDA should instruct the selected synthesizer to speak through.
</P>

<A NAME="VoiceSettings"></A>
<H4> ٣.١.٨. Voice Settings (NVDA+control+v)</H4>

<P>
The Voice Settings dialog, found in the Preferences menu, contains options that let you change the sound of the speech.
For a quicker alternative way of controlling speech parameters from anywhere, please see the <A HREF="#SynthSettingsRing">Synth Settings Ring</A> section.
</P>
<P>
The Voice Settings dialog box contains the following options:
</P>

<H5>Voice</H5>

<P>
The first option that you land on in this dialog is a combo box listing all the voices of the current synthesizer that you have installed.
You can use the arrow keys to listen to all the various choices.
Left and Up arrow take you up in the list, while right and down arrow moves you down in the list.
</P>

<H5>Variant</H5>

<P>
If you are using the Espeak synthesizer that is packaged with NVDA, this is a combo box that lets you select the Variant the synthesizer should speak with.
ESpeak's Variants are rather like voices, as they provide slightly different attributes to the eSpeak voice.
Some variants will sound like a male, some like a female, and some even like a frog.
</P>

<H5>Rate</H5>

<P>
This option allows you to change the rate of your voice.
This is a slider that goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the slowest, 100 being the fastest).
</P>

<H5>Pitch</H5>

<P>
This option allows you to change the pitch of the current voice.
It is a slider which goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the lowest pitch and 100 being the highest).
</P>

<H5>Volume</H5>

<P>
This option is a slider which goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the lowest volume and 100 being the highest).
</P>

<H5>Inflection</H5>

<P>
This option is a slider that lets you choose how much inflection (rise and fall in pitch) the synthesizer should use to speak with. (The only synthesizer that provides this option at the present time is eSpeak).
</P>

<H5>Automatic Language switching</H5>

<P>
This checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not NVDA should switch speech synthesizer languages on the fly, if language markup is available in the text being read.
This option is enabled by default.
Currently only the eSpeak synthesizer supports automatic language switching.
</P>

<H5>Automatic Dialect switching</H5>

<P>
If automatic language switching is turned on, this checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not dialect changes should be made, rather than just actual language changes. E.g. If reading in an English U.S. voice but a document states some text is in English U.K. then if this feature is enabled the synthesizer will switch accents.
This option is disabled by default.
</P>

<H5>Punctuation/Symbol Level</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+p
</P>
<P>
This allows you to choose the amount of punctuation and other symbols that should be spoken as words.
For example, when set to all, all symbols will be spoken as words.
This option applies to all synthesizers, not just the currently active synthesizer.
</P>

<H5>Capital pitch change percentage</H5>

<P>
This edit field allows you to type the amount that the pitch of the voice will change when speaking a capital letter.
This value is a percentage, where a negative value lowers the pitch and a positive value raises it.
For no pitch change you would use 0.
</P>

<H5>Say "cap" before capitals</H5>

<P>
This setting is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to say the word "cap" before any capital letter when spoken as an individual character such as when spelling.
Usually, NVDA raises the pitch slightly for any capital letter, but some synthesizers may not support this well, so perhaps this option may be of use.
</P>

<H5>Beep for capitals</H5>

<P>
If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will make a small beep each time it encounters a capitalized character by itself.
Like the "say cap for capitals" checkbox, this is useful for Synthesizers that can't change their pitch for capital letters.
</P>

<A NAME="VoiceSpellingFunctionality"></A>
<H5>Use spelling functionality if supported</H5>

<P>
Some words consist of only one character, but the pronunciation is different depending on whether the character is being spoken as an individual character (such as when spelling) or a word.
For example, in English, "a" is both a letter and a word.
This option allows the synthesizer to differentiate between these two cases if the synthesizer supports this.
Most synthesizers do support it.
</P>
<P>
This option should generally be enabled.
However, some Microsoft Speech API synthesizers do not implement this correctly and behave strangely when it is enabled.
If you are having problems with the pronunciation of individual characters, try disabling this option.
</P>

<A NAME="SynthSettingsRing"></A>
<H4> ٤.١.٨. Synth settings ring</H4>

<P>
If you wish to quickly change speech settings without going to the Voice settings dialog, there are some NVDA key commands that allow you to move through the most common speech settings from anywhere while running NVDA:

<A NAME="toc56"></A>
<H4> ٥.١.٨. Braille Settings</H4>

<P>
The braille settings dialog box can be invoked by going to the preferences menu and then to the braille settings option.
</P>

<H5>Braille Display</H5>

<P>
The first option you will come upon in the braille settings dialog is a combo box that says "braille display".
You will be presented with several options depending on what braille display drivers are available on your system.
Move between these options with the arrow keys.
</P>
<P>
No braille means that you are not using braille.
</P>
<P>
Please see the <A HREF="#SupportedBrailleDisplays">Supported Braille Displays</A> section for more information about supported braille displays.
</P>

<H5>Port</H5>

<P>
This option, if available, allows you to choose what port or type of connection will be used to communicate with the braille display you have selected.
It is a combo box containing the possible choices for your braille display.
</P>
<P>
By default, NVDA employs automatic port detection, which means the connection with the braille device will be established automatically by scanning for available USB and bluetooth devices on your system.
However, for some braille displays, you may be able to explicitly choose what port should be used.
Common options are "Automatic" (which tells NVDA to employ the default automatic port selection procedure), "USB", "Bluetooth" and legacy serial communication ports if your braille display supports this type of communication.
</P>
<P>
This option won't be available if your braille display only supports automatic port detection.
</P>
<P>
You may consult the documentation for your braille display in the section <A HREF="#SupportedBrailleDisplays">Supported Braille Displays</A> to check for more details on the supported types of communication and available ports.
</P>

<H5>Output Table</H5>

<P>
The next option you will come to in this dialog is the braille output table combo box.
In this combo box, you will find braille tables for different languages, braille standards and grades.
The chosen table will be used to translate text into braille to be presented on your braille display.
You can move from braille table to braille table in the list by using the arrow keys.
</P>

<H5>Input Table</H5>

<P>
Complementary to the previous option, the next setting you will find is the braille input table combo box.
The chosen table will be used to translate braille entered on your braille display's Perkins-style keyboard into text.
NVDA currently only supports computer braille input, so only 8 dot computer braille tables will be shown.
You can move from braille table to braille table in the list by using the arrow keys.
</P>
<P>
Note that this option is only useful if your braille display has a Perkins-style keyboard and this feature is supported by the braille display driver.
If input is not supported on a display which does have a braille keyboard, this will be noted in the <A HREF="#SupportedBrailleDisplays">Supported Braille Displays</A> section.
</P>

<H5>Expand to computer braille for the word at the cursor</H5>

<P>
This option allows the word that is under the cursor to be displayed in non-contracted computer braille.
</P>

<H5>Cursor Blink Rate</H5>

<P>
This option is a numerical field that allows you to change the blink rate of the cursor in milliseconds.
</P>

<H5>Message Timeout (sec)</H5>

<P>
This option is a numerical field that controls how long NVDA messages are displayed on the braille display.
Specifying 0 disables displaying of these messages completely.
</P>

<A NAME="BrailleTether"></A>
<H5>Braille Tethered to</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+control+t
</P>
<P>
This option allows you to choose whether the braille display will follow the system focus, or whether it follows the navigator object / review cursor.
</P>

<H5>Read by Paragraph</H5>

<P>
If enabled, braille will be displayed by paragraphs instead of lines.
Also, the next and previous line commands will move by paragraph accordingly.
This means that you do not have to scroll the display at the end of each line even where more text would fit on the display.
This may allow for more fluent reading of large amounts of text.
It is disabled by default.
</P>

<A NAME="toc57"></A>
<H4> ٦.١.٨. Keyboard Settings (NVDA+control+k)</H4>

<P>
This dialog box is found in the Preferences menu, under "Keyboard settings...".
It contains the following options:
</P>

<H5>Keyboard layout</H5>

<P>
This combo box lets you choose what type of keyboard layout NVDA should use. Currently the two that come with NVDA are Desktop and Laptop.
</P>

<H5>Use capslock as an NVDA modifier key</H5>

<P>
If this checkbox is checked, capslock can be used as an NVDA modifier key.
</P>

<H5>Use extended insert as an NVDA modifier key</H5>

<P>
If this checkbox is checked, the extended insert key (usually found above the arrow keys, near home and end) can be used as an NVDA modifier key.
</P>

<H5>Use numpad insert as an NVDA modifier key</H5>

<P>
If this checkbox is checked, the insert key on the number pad can be used as an NVDA modifier key.
</P>

<H5>Speak Typed Characters</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+2
</P>
<P>
When enabled, NVDA will announce all characters you type on the keyboard.
</P>

<H5>Speak Typed Words</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+3
</P>
<P>
When enabled, NVDA will announce all words you type on the keyboard.
</P>

<H5>Speech interrupt for typed characters</H5>

<P>
If on, this option will cause speech to be interrupted each time a character is typed. This is on by default.
</P>

<H5>Speech interrupt for Enter key</H5>

<P>
If on, this option will cause speech to be interrupted each time the Enter key is pressed. This is on by default.
</P>

<H5>Beep if Typing Lowercase Letters when Caps Lock is On</H5>

<P>
When enabled, a warning beep will be heard if a letter is typed with the shift key while caps lock is on.
Generally, typing shifted letters with caps lock is unintentional and is usually due to not realising that caps lock is enabled.
Therefore, it can be quite helpful to be warned about this.
</P>

<H5>Speak Command Keys</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+4
</P>
<P>
When enabled, NVDA will announce all non-character keys you type on the keyboard. This includes key combinations such as control plus another letter.
</P>

<A NAME="MouseSettings"></A>
<H4> ٧.١.٨. Mouse Settings (NVDA+control+m)</H4>

<P>
The Mouse Settings dialog is found in the Preferences Menu, under "Mouse settings...".
It contains the following options:
</P>

<H5>Report Mouse Shape Changes</H5>

<P>
A checkbox, that when checked means that NVDA will announce the shape of the mouse pointer each time it changes.
The mouse pointer in Windows changes shape to convey certain information such as when something is editable, or when something is loading etc.
</P>

<H5>Enable mouse tracking</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+m
</P>
<P>
When enabled, NVDA will announce the text currently under the mouse pointer, as you move it around the screen. This allows you to find things on the screen, by physically moving the mouse, rather than trying to find them through object navigation.
</P>

<H5>Text unit resolution</H5>

<P>
If NVDA is set to announce the text under the mouse as you move it, this option allows you to choose exactly how much text will be spoken.
The options are character, word, line and paragraph.
</P>

<H5>Report role when mouse enters object</H5>

<P>
If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will announce the role (type) of object as the mouse moves in side it.
</P>

<H5>Play audio coordinates when mouse moves</H5>

<P>
Checking this checkbox makes NVDA play beeps as the mouse moves, so that the user can work out where the mouse is in regards to the dimensions of the screen.
</P>

<H5>Brightness controls audio coordinates volume</H5>

<P>
If the "play audio coordinates when mouse moves" checkbox is checked, then checking this checkbox means that the volume of the audio coordinates beeps is controled by how bright the screen is under the mouse.
This setting is unchecked by default.
</P>

</P>

<A NAME="toc60"></A>
<H4> ٩.١.٨. Object Presentation Settings (NVDA+control+o)</H4>

<P>
Found in the Preferences menu under "Object Presentation...".
This dialog box contains the following options:
</P>

<H5>Report Tool Tips</H5>

<P>
A checkbox that when checked tells NVDA to report tool tips as they appear.
Many Windows and controls show a small message (or tool tip) when you move the mouse pointer over them, or sometimes when you move the focus to them.
</P>

<H5>Report Help Balloons</H5>

<P>
This checkbox when checked tells NVDA to report help balloons as they appear.
Help Balloons are like tool tips, but are usually larger in size, and are associated with system events such as a network cable being unplugged, or perhaps to alert you about Windows security issues.
</P>

<H5>Report Object Shortcut Keys</H5>

<P>
When this checkbox is checked, NVDA will include the shortcut key that is associated with a certain object or control when it is reported.
For example the File menu on a menu bar may have a shortcut key of alt+f.
</P>

<H5>Report object position information</H5>

<P>
This option lets you choose whether you wish to have an object's position (e.g. 1 of 4) reported when moving to the object with the focus or object navigation.
</P>

<H5>Guess Object Position Information when unavailable</H5>

<P>
If reporting of object position information is turned on, this option allows NVDA to guess object position information when it is otherwise unavailable for a particular control.
</P>
<P>
When on, NVDA will report position information for more controls such as menus and toolbars, however this information may be slightly inaccurate.
</P>

<H5>Report Object descriptions</H5>

<P>
Uncheck this checkbox if you don't wish to have the description reported along with objects.
</P>

<H5>Progress bar output</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+u
</P>
<P>
This option controls how NVDA reports progress bar updates to you.
</P>
<P>
It has the following options:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Off: Progress bars will not be reported as they change.
<LI>Speak: This option tells NVDA to speak the progress bar in percentages. Each time the progress bar changes, NVDA will speak the new value.
<LI>Beep: This tells NVDA to beep each time the progress bar changes. The higher the beep, the closer the progress bar is to completion.
<LI>Beep and speak: This option tells NVDA to both beep and speak when a progress bar updates.
</UL>

<H5>Report background progress bars</H5>

<P>
This is an option that, when checked, tells NVDA to keep reporting a progress bar, even if it is not physically in the foreground.
If you minimize or switch away from a window that contains a progress bar, NVDA will keep track of it, allowing you to do other things while NVDA tracks the progress bar.
</P>

<H5>Report dynamic content changes</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+5
</P>
<P>
Toggles the announcement of new content in particular objects such as terminals and the history control in chat programs.
</P>

<A NAME="toc61"></A>
<H4> ١٠.١.٨. Input Composition Settings</H4>

<P>
The Input Composition Settings dialog can be found under the Preferences menu.
This dialog allows you to control how NVDA reports the input of Asian characters, such as with IME or Text Service input methods.
Note that due to the fact that input methods vary greatly by available features and by how they convey information, it will most likely be necessary to configure these options differently for each input method to get the most efficient typing experience.
</P>

<H5>Automatically report all available candidates</H5>

<P>
This option, which is on by default,  allows you to choose whether or not all visible candidates should be reported automatically when a candidate list appears or its page is changed.
Having this option on for pictographic input methods such as chinese New ChangJie or Boshiami is useful, as you can automatically hear all symbols and their numbers and you can choose one right away.
However, for phonetic input methods such as chinese New Phonetic, it may be more useful to turn this option off, as all the symbols will sound the same and you will have to use the arrow keys to navigate the list items individually to gain more information  from the character descriptions for each candidate.
</P>

<H5>Announce Selected Candidate</H5>

<P>
This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether NVDA should announce the selected candidate when a candidate list appears or when the selection is changed.
For input methods where the selection can be changed with the arrow keys  (such as Chinese New Phonetic) this is necessary, but for some input methods it may be more efficient typing with this option turned off.
Note that even with this option off, the review cursor will still be placed on the selected candidate allowing you to use object navigation / review to manually read this or other candidates.
</P>

<H5>Always include short character descriptions for candidates</H5>

<P>
This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should provide a short description for each character in a candidate, either when its selected or when its automatically read when the candidate list appears.
Note that for locales such as Chinese, the announcement of extra character descriptions for the selected candidate is not affected by this option.
This option may be useful for Korean and japanese input methods.
</P>

<H5>Report changes to the reading string</H5>

<P>
Some input methods such as Chinese New Phonetic and New ChangJie have a reading string (sometimes known as a precomposition string).
You can choose whether or not NVDA should announce new characters being typed into this reading string with this option.
This option is on by default.
Note some older input methods such as Chinese ChangJie may not use the reading string to hold precomposition characters, but instead use the composition string directly. Please see the next option for configuring reporting of the composition string.
</P>

<H5>Report changes to the composition string</H5>

<P>
After reading or precomposition data has been combined into a valid pictographic symbol, most input methods place this symbol into a composition string for temporary storage along with other combined symbols before they are finally inserted into the document.
This option allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should report new symbols as they appear  in the composition string.
This option is on by default.
</P>

<A NAME="toc62"></A>
<H4> ١١.١.٨. Browse Mode Settings (NVDA+control+b)</H4>

<P>
The Browse Mode settings dialog can be found in the Preferences menu, under "Browse mode...".
</P>
<P>
The dialog contains the following options:
</P>

<H5>Maximum Number of Characters on One Line</H5>

<P>
This field sets the maximum length of a line in browse mode (in characters).
</P>

<H5>Maximum Lines Per Page</H5>

<P>
This field sets the amount of lines you will move by when pressing page up or page down while in browse mode.
</P>

<H5>Use screen layout</H5>

<P>
Key: NVDA+v
</P>
<P>
This option allows you to specify whether content in browse mode should place content such as links and other fields on their own line, or if it should keep them in the flow of text as it is visually shown. If the option is enabled then things will stay as they are visually shown, but if it is disabled then fields will be placed on their own line.
</P>

<H5>Automatic Say All on page load</H5>

<P>
This checkbox toggles the automatic reading of a page after it loads in browse mode.
This option is enabled by default.
</P>

<H5>Include layout tables</H5>

<P>
This option affects how NVDA handles tables used purely for layout purposes.
When on, NVDA will treat these as normal tables, reporting them based on <A HREF="#DocumentFormattingSettings">Document Formatting Settings</A> and locating them with quick navigation commands.
When off, they will not be reported nor found with quick navigation.
However, the content of the tables will still be included as normal text.
This option is turned off by default.
</P>

<H5>Configuring reporting of fields such as links and headings</H5>

<P>
Please see the options in the <A HREF="#DocumentFormattingSettings">Document Formatting Settings dialog</A> to configure the fields that are reported when navigating, such as links, headings and tables.
</P>

<H5>Automatic focus mode for focus changes</H5>

<P>
This option allows focus mode to be invoked if focus changes.
For example, when on a web page, if you press tab and you land on a form, if this option is checked, focus mode will automatically be invoked.
</P>

<H5>Automatic focus mode for caret movement</H5>

<P>
This option, when checked, allows NVDA to enter and leave focus mode when using arrow keys.
For example, if arrowing down a webpage and you land on an edit box, NVDA will automatically bring you into focus mode. If you arrow out of the edit box, NVDA will put you back in browse mode.
</P>

<H5>Audio indication of Focus and Browse modes</H5>

<P>
If this option is enabled, NVDA will play special sounds when it switches between browse mode and focus mode, rather than speaking the change.
</P>

<A NAME="DocumentFormattingSettings"></A>
<H4> ١٢.١.٨. Document Formatting Settings (NVDA+control+d)</H4>

<P>
This dialog box is found in the Preferences menu, under "Document Formatting...".
</P>
<P>
Most of the checkboxes in this dialog are for configuring what type of formatting you wish to have reported as you move the cursor around documents.
For example, if you check the report font name checkbox, each time you arrow onto text with a different font, the name of the font will be announced.
</P>
<P>
You can configure reporting of:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Font name
<LI>Font size
<LI>Font attributes
<LI>Text alignment
<LI>Colors
<LI>Text style
<LI>Spelling errors
<LI>Page numbers
<LI>Line numbers
<LI>Line indentation
<LI>Tables
<LI>Table row/column headers
<LI>Table cell coordinates
<LI>Links
<LI>Headings
<LI>Lists
<LI>Block quotes
<LI>Landmarks
<LI>Frames
</UL>

<H5>Announce formatting changes after the cursor</H5>

<P>
If enabled, this setting tells NVDA to try and detect all the formatting changes on a line as it speaks it, even if doing this may slow down NVDA's performance.
</P>
<P>
By default, NVDA will detect the formatting at the position of the System caret / Review Cursor, and in some instances may detect formatting on the rest of the line, only if it is not going to cause a performance decrease.
</P>
<P>
Enable this option while proof reading documents in applications such as Microsoft Word, where formatting is important.
</P>

<A NAME="toc64"></A>
<H4> ١٣.١.٨. Speech dictionaries</H4>

<P>
The speech dictionaries menu (found in the Preferences menu) contains dialogs that allow you to manage the way NVDA pronounces particular words or phrases.
There are currently three different types of speech dictionaries.
They are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Default: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA.
<LI>Voice: rules in this dictionary affect speech for the synthesizer voice currently being used.
<LI>Temporary: rules in this dictionary affect all speech in NVDA, but only for the current session. These rules are temporary and will be lost if NVDA is restarted.
</UL>

<P>
All dictionary dialogs contain a list of rules which will be used for processing the speech.
The dialog also contains Add, Edit and remove buttons.
</P>
<P>
To add a new rule to the dictionary, press the Add button, and fill in the fields in the dialog box that appears and then press Ok.
You will then see your new rule in the list of rules.
However to make sure your rule is actually saved, make sure to press Ok to exit the dictionary dialog all together once you have finished adding/editing rules.
</P>
<P>
The rules for NVDA's speech dictionaries allow you to change one string of characters into another.
A simple example would be that you want to have NVDA say the word frog each time it is supposed to say the word bird.
In the Add rule dialog, the easiest way to do this is to type the word bird in the Pattern field, and the word frog in the Replacement field.
You may also want to type a description of the rule in the Comment field (something like: changes bird to frog).
</P>
<P>
NVDA's speech dictionaries however are much more powerful than simple word replacement.
The Add rule dialog also contains a checkbox to say whether or not you want the rule to be case sensitive (meaning that NVDA should care whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase.
NVDA ignores case by default).
Another checkbox allows you to state whether your pattern is a "Regular expression".
A regular expression is a pattern containing special symbols that allow you to match on more than one character at a time, or match on just numbers, or just letters, as a few examples.
Regular expressions are not covered in this user guide, but there are many tutorials on the web which can provide you with more information.
</P>

<A NAME="SymbolPronunciation"></A>
<H4> ١٤.١.٨. Punctuation/symbol pronunciation</H4>

<P>
This dialog allows you to change the way punctuation and other symbols are pronounced, as well as the symbol level at which they are spoken.
</P>
<P>
To change a symbol, first select it in the Symbols list.
The Replacement field allows you to change the text that should be spoken in place of this symbol.
Using the Level field, you can adjust the lowest symbol level at which this symbol should be spoken.
</P>
<P>
When you are finished, press the OK button to save your changes or the Cancel button to discard them.
</P>

<A NAME="toc66"></A>
<H3> ٢.٨. Saving and Reloading the configuration</H3>

<P>
By default NVDA will automatically save your settings on exit.
Note, however, that this option can be changed under the general options in the preferences menu.
To save the settings manually at any time, choose the Save configuration item in the NVDA menu.
</P>
<P>
If you ever make a mistake with your settings and need to revert back to the saved settings, choose the "revert to saved configuration" item in the NVDA menu.
You can also reset your settings to their original factory defaults by choosing Reset Configuration To Factory Defaults, which is also found in the NVDA menu.
</P>
<P>
The following NVDA key commands are also useful:

</TABLE>

<A NAME="toc67"></A>
<H3> ٣.٨. Configuration files and user profiles</H3>

<P>
Portable versions of NVDA store all settings, custom appModules and custom drivers in a directory called userConfig, found in the NVDA directory.
</P>
<P>
Installed versions of NVDA store all settings, custom appModules and custom drivers in a special NVDA directory located in your Windows user profile.
This means that each user on the system can have their own NVDA settings.
To get to your settings directory for an installed version of NVDA, on the start menu you can go to programs -&gt; NVDA -&gt; explore user configuration directory.
</P>
<P>
Settings for NVDA when running on the logon or UAC screens is stored in the systemConfig directory in NVDA's installation directory.
Usually this configuration should not be touched.
To change how NVDA is configured on the logon/UAC screens, configure NVDA to how you wish while logged into Windows, and then instruct NVDA to copy the configuration to the logon screen by using the button in the General settings dialog.
</P>

<A NAME="toc68"></A>
<H2> ٩. Extra Tools</H2>

<A NAME="toc69"></A>
<H3> ١.٩. Log Viewer</H3>

<P>
The log viewer, found under Tools in the NVDA menu, allows you to view all the logging output that has occured up until now from when you last started NVDA.
</P>
<P>
Apart from reading the content, you can also Save a copy of the log file, or refresh the viewer so that it shows the most recent output since the Log viewer was opened.
These actions are available under the viewer's Log menu.
</P>

<A NAME="toc70"></A>
<H3> ٢.٩. Speech Viewer</H3>

<P>
For sighted software developers or people demoing NVDA to sighted audiences, a floating window is available that allows you to view all the text that NVDA is currently speaking.
</P>
<P>
To enable the speech viewer, check the "Speech Viewer" menu item under Tools in the NVDA menu.
Uncheck the menu item to disable it.
</P>
<P>
While the speech viewer is enabled, it constantly updates to show you the most current text being spoken.
However, if you click or focus inside the viewer, NVDA will temporarily stop updating the text, so that you are able to easily select or copy the existing content.
</P>

<A NAME="toc71"></A>
<H3> ٣.٩. Add-ons Manager</H3>

<P>
The Add-ons Manager, accessed by selecting Manage add-ons under Tools in the NVDA menu, allows you to install and uninstall add-on packages for NVDA.
These packages are provided by the community and contain custom code that may add or change features in NVDA or even provide support for extra Braille displays or speech synthesizers.
</P>
<P>
The Add-ons Manager contains a list that displays all the add-ons currently installed in your NVDA user configuration. 
A package name, version and author are shown for each add-on, though further information such as a description and URL can be viewed by selecting the add-on and pressing the About add-on button.
</P>
<P>
To browse and download available add-ons online, press the Get add-ons button.
This button opens the <A HREF="http://addons.nvda-project.org/">NVDA Add-ons page</A>.
If NVDA is installed on your system, you can open the add-on directly from the browser to begin the installation process as described below.
Otherwise, save the add-on package and follow the instructions below.
</P>
<P>
To install an Add-on you previously obtained, press the Install button.
This will allow you to browse for an add-on package (.nvda-addon file) somewhere on your computer or on a network.
Once you press Open, the installation process will begin.
</P>
<P>
When an add-on is being installed, NVDA will first ask you to confirm that you really wish to install the add-on.
As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.
Once the add-on is installed, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running. 
Until you do, a status of "install" will show for that add-on in the list.
</P>
<P>
To remove an add-on, select the add-on from the list and press the Remove button.
NVDA will ask if you really wish to do this.
As with installing, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to be fully  removed.
Until you do, a status of "remove" will be shown for that add-on in the list.
</P>
<P>
The manager also has a Close button to close the dialog.
If you have installed or removed add-ons, NVDA will first ask you if you wish to restart so that your changes can take effect.
</P>
<P>
In the past it has been possible to extend NVDA's functionality by copying individual plugins and drivers in to your NVDA user Configuration directory.
Although this version of NVDA  may still   load them, they will not be shown in the Add-on Manager.
It is best to remove these files from your configuration and install  the appropriate add-on if one is available.
</P>

<A NAME="toc72"></A>
<H3> ٤.٩. Python Console</H3>

<P>

<A NAME="SupportedBrailleDisplays"></A>
<H2> ١١. Supported Braille Displays</H2>

<P>
This section contains information about the Braille displays supported by NVDA.
</P>

<A NAME="toc83"></A>
<H3> ١.١١. Freedom Scientific Focus/PAC Mate Series</H3>

<P>
All Focus and PAC Mate displays from <A HREF="http://www.freedomscientific.com/">Freedom Scientific</A> are supported when connected via USB or bluetooth.
You will need the Freedom Scientific braille display drivers installed on your system.
If you do not have them already, you can obtain them from <A HREF="http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/focus-40-blue/focus-40-blue-downloads.asp">http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/focus-40-blue/focus-40-blue-downloads.asp</A>.
Although this page only mentions the Focus 40 Blue display, the drivers support all Freedom Scientific displays.
If your system is running 64 bit Windows and the drivers were already installed by another screen reader, you will probably still need to install the drivers from this link, as the files required by NVDA were probably not installed by the other screen reader.
</P>
<P>
By default, NVDA can automatically detect and connect to these displays either via USB or bluetooth.
However, when configuring the display, you can explicitly select "USB" or "Bluetooth" ports to restrict the connection type to be used.
This might be useful if you want to connect the focus display to NVDA using bluetooth, but still be able to charge it using USB power from your computer.

<H3> ١٢.١١. Papenmeier BRAILLEX Newer Models</H3>

<P>
The following Braille displays are supported: 
</P>

<UL>
<LI>BRAILLEX EL 40c, EL 80c, EL 20c, EL 60c (USB)
<LI>BRAILLEX EL 40s, EL 80s, EL 2d80s, EL 70s, EL 66s (USB)
<LI>BRAILLEX Trio (USB and bluetooth)
</UL>

<P>
If BrxCom is installed, NVDA will use BrxCom.
BrxCom is a tool that allows you to use the Braille input independently from a screen reader.
A new version of BrxCom which works with NVDA will be released by Papenmeier soon.  
However, braille input is possible with the Trio device without BrxCom.
</P>
<P>
Most devices have an Easy Access Bar (EAB) that allows intuitive and fast operation.
The EAB can be moved in four directions where generally each direction has two switches.
The c-series is the only exception to this rule.
</P>
<P>
The c-series and some other displays have two routing rows whereby the upper row is used to report formatting information.
Holding one of the upper routing keys and pressing the EAB on c-series devices emulates the second switch state.
Pressing and holding the up, down, right and left keys (or EAB) causes the corresponding action to be repeated.
</P>

<H3> ١٥.١١. BRLTTY</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="http://mielke.cc/brltty/">BRLTTY</A> is a separate program which can be used to support many more braille displays.
In order to use this, you need to install <A HREF="http://brl.thefreecat.org/brltty/">BRLTTY for Windows</A>.
You should download and install the latest installer package, which will be named, for example, brltty-win-4.2-2.exe.
When configuring the display and port to use, be sure to pay close attention to the instructions, especially if you are using a USB display and already have the manufacturer's drivers installed.
</P>
<P>
For displays which have a braille keyboard, BRLTTY currently handles braille input itself.
Therefore, NVDA's braille input table setting is not relevant.
</P>
<P>
Following are the BRLTTY command assignments for NVDA.
Please see the <A HREF="http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/drivers/">BRLTTY key tables documentation</A> for information about how BRLTTY commands are mapped to controls on braille displays.

<H3> ١.١٢. Remapping Key Assignments and Other Input Gestures</H3>

<P>
Users are able to provide or override mappings of input gestures (such as key presses) to scripts in a special file in the user's NVDA configuration directory.
This file is called gestures.ini.
</P>
<P>
This file uses standard ini syntax.
The file may contain multiple sections and each section may have one or more entries.
</P>
<P>
Each section provides mappings for scripts in a particular Python module and class inside NVDA.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The section name should be the Python module and class separated by a dot (.).
<LI>The key of each entry is the name of the script to which input gestures should be bound.
Alternatively, you can use None to unbind input gestures from a script to which they were previously bound.
Each entry key can only be listed once per section, including None.
<LI>The entry value is a comma (,) separated list of gesture identifiers for the input gestures that should be bound.
Gesture identifiers ending in a comma must be enclosed in quotes (" or ').
</UL>

<P>
Gesture identifiers consist of a two letter device code; a sub-device, layout or mode in brackets; a colon; and then a type-specific string identifying the actual input, such as key or touch gesture names.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>For keyboard gestures, the device code is kb.
The part in brackets is the keyboard layout and is optional.
If not specified, the gesture will apply to all keyboard layouts.
The string after the colon is one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.
<LI>For braille display gestures, the device code is br.
The part in brackets identifies the specific braille display and is mandatory.
The string after the colon is one or more key names separated by a plus (+) sign.
<LI>For touch gestures, the device code is ts.
The part in brackets is the touch mode and is optional.
The string after the colon is a touch gesture; e.g. double_tap, 2fingerflickUp or 3finger_tap.
</UL>

<P>
In order to discover gesture identifiers, script names and the class and module in which they are contained, you can:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Turn on Input Help.
<LI>Activate the gesture (press the key, touch the screen, etc.).
<LI>Turn off input help.
<LI>Activate View log in the NVDA Tools menu.
<LI>Examine the recent log entries.
One of these should provide information about the input gesture you sent, including the module.class and script if it is bound to one.
</OL>

<P>
Following is an example of how you could bind NVDA+shift+t to the date time script.
</P>
<P>
To find out the correct script name and module.class for date time, you would turn on Input Help and press NVDA+f12 (as this is the current gesture for the date time script).
You would then turn off Input Help and examine the log viewer.
</P>
<P>
Towards the bottom, you would see:
</P>

<PRE>
  INFO - inputCore.InputManager._handleInputHelp (13:17:22):
  Input help: gesture kb(desktop):NVDA+f12, bound to script dateTime on globalCommands.GlobalCommands
</PRE>

<P>
From this, you can see that the script name is dateTime and the module.class is globalCommands.GlobalCommands.
</P>
<P>
If the file does not yet exist, you would create a text file called gestures.ini in the user configuration directory and add the following content:
</P>

<PRE>
  [globalCommands.GlobalCommands]
  	dateTime = kb:NVDA+shift+t
</PRE>

<P>
This would bind the key press NVDA+shift+t (in any keyboard layout) to the dateTime script.
</P>
<P>
Note that the original NVDA+f12 binding would still work.
If you wanted to remove this binding, you would add the following line:
</P>

<PRE>
  	None = kb:NVDA+f12
</PRE>

<P>
Although you are free to have scripts bound to any available key, it may be problematic to use the alt key on the keyboard.
NVDA still sends modifier keys (such as shift, control and alt) to the Operating System, even if they eventuate in a script.
Thus, if you do use alt in a gesture, pressing this key combination may activate the menu bar, as well as executing the script.
Therefore, it is probably best to just use Shift, control and the NVDA modifier key as modifiers.

<H3> ٢.١٢. Advanced Customization of Symbol Pronunciation</H3>

<P>
It is possible to customize the pronunciation of punctuation and other symbols beyond what can be done using the <A HREF="#SymbolPronunciation">Punctuation/symbol pronunciation</A> dialog.
For example, you can specify whether the raw symbol should be sent to the synthesizer (e.g. to cause a pause or change in inflection) and you can add custom symbols.
</P>
<P>
To do this, you must edit the symbol pronunciation information file in your NVDA user configuration directory.
The file is called symbols-xx.dic, where xx is the language code.
The format of this file is documented in the Symbol Pronunciation section of the NVDA Developer Guide, which is available from <A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/wiki/Development">the Development section of the NVDA web site</A>.
However, it is not possible for users to define complex symbols.
