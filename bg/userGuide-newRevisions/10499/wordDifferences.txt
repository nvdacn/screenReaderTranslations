+{++ Command Line Options ++[CommandLineOptions]
NVDA can accept one or more additional options when it starts which alter its behavior.
You can pass as many options as you need.
These options can be passed when starting from a shortcut (in the shortcut properties), from the Run dialog (Start Menu -> Run or Windows+r) or from a Windows command console.
Options should be separated from the name of NVDA's executable file and from other options by spaces.
For example, the Desktop shortcut that NVDA creates during installation has the -r option, which tells NVDA to close the currently running copy before starting the new one.
Another useful option is --disable-addons, which tells NVDA to suspend all running add-ons.
This allows you to determine whether a problem is caused by an add-on and to recover from serious problems caused by add-ons.

As an example, you can exit the currently running copy of NVDA by entering the following in the Run dialog:

nvda -q

Some of the command line options have a short and a long version, while some of them have only a long version.
For those which have a short version, you can combine them like this:
| nvda -rm | This will exit the currently running copy of NVDA and will start a new copy with startup sounds disabled, etc. |
| nvda -rm --disable-addons | Same as above, but with add-ons disabled |

Some of the command line options accept additional parameters; e.g. how detailed the logging should be or the path to the user configuration directory.
Those parameters should be placed after the option, separated from the option by a space when using the short version or an equals sign (=) when using the long version; e.g.:
| nvda -l 10 | Tells NVDA to start with log level set to debug |
| nvda --log-file=c:\nvda.log |  Tells NVDA to write its log to c:\nvda.log |
| nvda --log-level=20 -f c:\nvda.log | Tels NVDA to start with log level set to info and to write its log to c:\nvda.log |

Following are the command line options for NVDA:
|| Short | Long | Description |
| -h | --help | show command line help and exit |
| -q | --quit | Quit already running copy of NVDA |
| -r | --replace | Quit already running copy of NVDA and start this one |
| -k | --check-running | Report whether NVDA is running via the exit code; 0 if running, 1 if not running |
| -f LOGFILENAME | --log-file=LOGFILENAME | The file where log messages should be written to |
| -l LOGLEVEL | --log-level=LOGLEVEL | The lowest level of message logged (debug 10, info 20, warning 30, error 40, critical 50), default is warning |
| -c CONFIGPATH | --config-path=CONFIGPATH | The path where all settings for NVDA are stored |
| -m | --minimal | No sounds, no interface, no start message etc |
| -s | --secure | Secure mode (disable Python console) |
| None | --disable-addons | Addons will have no effect |
| None | --no-sr-flag  | Don't change the global system screen reader flag |
| None | --install | Silently installs NVDA |}+

++ Advanced Customization of Symbol Pronunciation ++
It is possible to customize the pronunciation of punctuation and other symbols beyond what can be done using the [Punctuation/symbol pronunciation #SymbolPronunciation] dialog.
For example, you can specify whether the raw symbol should be sent to the synthesizer (e.g. to cause a pause or change in inflection) and you can add custom symbols.
