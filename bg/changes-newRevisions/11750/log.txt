    Reporting of mouse shape changes again works as expected.
    
    * Cursor events end up firing on the desktop window, so shouldAcceptEvent had to be taught this.
    * The previous code relied on counting core ticks, but now that core ticks are on-demand, this needed to be updated to use a timer.
    
    Fixes #5595.
