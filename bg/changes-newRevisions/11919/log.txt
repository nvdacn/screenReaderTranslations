    Switch to building with Visual Studio 2015. This is mandatory; no other version will work.
    
    * Upgrade to Scons 2.4.1 providing support for VC2015
    * Ignore warning c4091: unnamed typedef enums (in Windows SDK 7.1a dbghelp.h).
    * fix warnings c4302, c4311, and c4312 (trunkation or extending when casting from a 32 bit type to a 64 bit type or the other way around):
     * VBuf docHandles are now unsigned longs instead of ints.
     * Replace all explicit casts from unsigned long to handles (HANDLE, HWND) with UlongToHandle.
     * Replace all explicit casts from  handles (HANDLE, HWND) to unsigned long with HandleToUlong.
    * MSHTML vbufBackend: fix syntax of string concatination with a define to be compatibal with VC2015. Strings can now have a suffix letter, thus two strings that should be joined must now contain a space between them.
    
    Fixes #5592.
