    In Google Chrome and Chrome-based browsers in a language other than English, browse mode no longer fails to work in many documents.
    
    Chrome incorrectly localises the name returned by IAccessibleAction::name, but this means it contains a space for some actions in some languages; e.g. "click" is "fai clic" in Italian. This results in the buffer producing an invalid XML attribute name, which breaks reading of affected content. We now filter the XML so this doesn't happen.
    
    Issue #6249. PR #6295.
