== Changes ==
- If an object you have moved to with object navigation is inside a browse mode document, but the object you were on previously was not, the review mode is automatically set to document. Previously this only happened if the navigator object was moved due to the focus changing. (#4369)


== Bug Fixes ==
- When moving focus back to a browse mode document (e.g. alt tabbing to an already opened web page) the review cursor is properly positioned at the virtual caret, rather than the focused control (e.g. a near by link). (#4369)
- In Powerpoint slide shows, the review cursor correctly follows the virtual caret. (#4370)
- In Mozilla Firefox and other Gecko-based browsers, new content within a live region will be announced even if the new content has a usable ARIA live type different to the parent live region. E.g. Content marked as assertive is added to a live region marked as polite. (#4169).
