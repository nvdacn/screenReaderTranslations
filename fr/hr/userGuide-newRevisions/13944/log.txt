    Added the possibility to create a portable copy with the use of command line parameters (PR #6329)
    
    * Added the possibility to create a portable copy with the use of command line parameters:
      * --create-portable: creates a new portable copy and starts it after creation
      * --create-portable-silent: creates a new portable copy and shuts down NVDA
    
    Both parameters depend on the --portable-path parameter, which has to contain the path to the new portable copy.
    
    IN the process, added a new checkbox to the create portable copy dialog which allows for starting the new copy after installation.
