 All Focus and PAC Mate displays from [Freedom Scientific http://www.freedomscientific.com/] are supported when connected via USB or bluetooth.

-Although this page only mentions the Focus 40 Blue display, the drivers support all Freedom Scientific displays.

 If your system is running 64 bit Windows and the drivers were already installed by another screen reader, you will probably still need to install the drivers from this link, as the files required by NVDA were probably not installed by the other screen reader.
 
 By default, NVDA can automatically detect and connect to these displays either via USB or bluetooth.
