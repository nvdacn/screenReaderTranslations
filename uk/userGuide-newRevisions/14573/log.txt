    Add "report formatting for text under braille cell" command (#7189)
    
    * Add a "report formatting info for text under this braille cell" command.
    
    * Assign the Alva BC6 secondary cursor routing keys to the new report formatting command.
    
    * Update copyrights.
    
    * Update user guide for the new Alva BC6 key assignment.
    
    * Also use the new report formatting braille command in both Papenmeier drivers.
    This removes their "route to and report formatting" behavior. Instead, it now only reports formatting without routing the cursor.
    
    * Address review actions.
    
    * Update user docs.
    
    * Add the report text formatting under braille cell command to the EuroBraille displays.
    
    * Revert browseable message for the report text formatting under braille cell command.
    
    * Incorporate PR #7990.
    
    * Add translator comment
