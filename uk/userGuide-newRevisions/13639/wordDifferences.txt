++ SuperBraille ++
The SuperBraille device, mostly available in Taiwan, can be connected to by either USB or serial.
As the SuperBraille does not have any physical typing keys or scrolling buttons, all input must be performed via a standard computer keyboard.
Due to this, and to maintain compatibility with other screen readers in Taiwan, two key bindings for scrolling the braille display have been provided:
%kc:beginInclude
|| Name | Key |
| Scroll braille display back | numpadMinus |
| Scroll braille display forward | numpadPlus}+ | 
%kc:endInclude

++ BRLTTY ++
[BRLTTY http://www.brltty.com/] is a separate program which can be used to support many more braille displays.
In order to use this, you need to install [BRLTTY for Windows http://www.brltty.com/download.html].
