message:
  gecko_ia2 vbuf: Listen for scrollingStart events even before the buffer is fully rendered and then move to that object once rendered.
  In particular, Gecko 10 now always fires scrollingStart if appropriate the first time the document is focused, so this means we'll almost always get the right position if the document is loaded while NVDA is running.
  Partial fix for #360.
