message:
  When using a contracted braille table and expand to computer braille for the word at the cursor is enabled, the braille cursor is now positioned correctly when located after a word wherein a character is represented by multiple braille cells (e.g. capital sign, letter sign, number sign, etc.).
  Specifically, we no longer rely on the output cursorPos provided by liblouis, instead calculating this based on rawToBraillePos, which is usually accurate.
