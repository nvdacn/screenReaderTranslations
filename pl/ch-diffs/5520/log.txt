message:
  Fix for #961 (unable to save speech dictionary entries with a # character at start).  When dictionary entries are saved, all # characters in the pattern or replacement are converted to \# and when loading dictionaries any \# is converted to #. Technically if a # character was used by itself after the first character this would still also work, but the general rule is that the .dic files will encode # as \# in the fields.
