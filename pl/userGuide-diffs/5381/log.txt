message:
  Support for Asian character Input, including reporting and navigation of candidate lists, reporting and navigation of composition strings, and reporting of reading string changes. Supports both IME and TSF in XP and Win7 (we assume Vista). May be still some loose ends, but needs a lot of heavy testing from the community.
