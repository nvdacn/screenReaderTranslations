+++ Touch Gestures +++


When NVDA commands are described 
-{further along}-
 
+{later}+
 in this user guide, they may list a touch gesture which can be used to activate that command with the touch screen.
Following are some instructions on how to perform the various touch 
-{gestures required to perform  NVDA commands with a touch screen.}-
 
+{gestures.}+


==== Taps ====
Tap the screen quickly with one or more fingers.

Tapping once with one  finger is simpley known as a tap.

Tapping with 2 fingers at the same time is a 2-finger 
-{tap,}-
 
+{tap}+
 and so on.


If the same tap is performed one or more times again in quick succession, NVDA will instead 
-{see}-
 
+{treat this as}+
 a 
-{special}-
 multi-tap gesture.
Tapping twice will result in a double tap.




Tapping 3 times will result in a 
-{tripple tap,}-
 
+{triple tap}+
 and so on.
Of 
-{course}-
 
+{course,}+
 these multi-tap gestures also recognize how many fingers were used, so 
-{its}-
 
+{it's}+
 possible to have gestures like a 2-finger 
-{tripple}-
 
+{triple}+
 tap, 
-{or}-
 a 4-finger tap, etc. 

==== Flicks ====
Quickly swipe your finger across the screen.


There are 4 possible flick gestures depending on the direction: flick left, flick right, flick 
-{up,}-
 
+{up}+
 and flick down.

Just like taps, more than one finger can be used to perform the gesture.

 gestures such as 2-finger flick up

+++ Touch Modes +++


As there are many more NVDA commands

 certain subsets of commands available.
The two modes 
-{that exist for now}-
 are text mode and object mode. 
Certain NVDA commands listed in this document may have a touch mode listed in brackets after the touch gesture.


For 
-{example:}-
 
+{example,}+
 flick up (text mode) means that the command will be performed if you flick up, but only while in text mode.
If the command does not have a mode 
-{associated with it,}-
 
+{listed,}+
 it will work in any mode.

Many

 commands are mentioned 
-{through out}-

 the rest of this user guide, but an easy way to explore all the different commands is to turn on input help.

To turn on input help, press NVDA+1.
To turn it off, press NVDA+1 again.

The actual  commands will not execute while in input help mode.

++ The NVDA menu ++
The NVDA menu allows you to control NVDA's settings, access help, save/revert your configuration, Modify speech dictionaries, access additional tools and exit NVDA.


To get to the NVDA menu from anywhere in Windows while NVDA is running, press NVDA+n on the 
-{keyboard,}-
 
+{keyboard}+
 or perform a 2-finger double tap on 
-{a}-
 
+{the}+

You can also get to the NVDA menu via the windows system tray.
Either right-click on the NVDA icon located in the system tray, or access the system tray by pressing the windows logo key+B, DownArrow to the NVDA icon and press the applications key located next to the right control key on most keyboards.
