message:
  More options for input composition:
  	* Announce Selected Candidate: allows to configure whether or not NVDA should announce the selected candidate when a candidate list appears or when the selection is changed. Note that if this option is turned off the review cursor is still placed on the candidate.
  	* Report Composition string changes: Allows you to configure whether or not NVDA will announce changes to the composition string.
