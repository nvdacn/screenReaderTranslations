message:
  Updated user guide to include a section on touch gestures. Added a Touch column to some of the NVDA command tables so that they now include touch gestures for commands that have them. Mentioned touch when talking about remapping gestures. Changed a few mentions of "key commands" to "NVDA commands" and the like.
