    When selecting text, the text is reported before the indication of selection instead of after.
    
    * When selecting text, announce "selected" after the text rather than "selecting" before.
    * When unselecting text announce "unselected" after the text rather than "unselecting" before.
    * When removing the selection entirely and also selecting something else announce "selected instead" after the new text rather than 'selection removed" and then "selecting" and the new text.
    
    Fixes #1707.
