    NVDAHelper IME support: only call hasValidIMEContext for specific IME window messages, rather than for all window messages. Fixes #2909
    
    This stops ImmLockIMC from being called for window messages such as wm_keydown which was causing some corruption of typed characters in certain situations such as when typing in NVDA's process with Korean or Japanese when it was the default IME.
