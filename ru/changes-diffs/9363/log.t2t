    In Internet Explorer, It is again not necessary to press tab to interact with an embedded object (such as Flash content) after pressing enter on it.
    
    Previously, the code assumed that all objects that *might* be Flash were definitely not MSHTML. However, after the change to support Flash in Windows 8 IE, this assumption is incorrect.
    Fixes #3364.
