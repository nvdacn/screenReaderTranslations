    In the Skype recent conversations list, the number of new events is now read for each conversation if relevant.
    
    We're now using the name as intended (which includes the new event count) instead of overriding it with the value. This does mean that the Skype name is no longer included, but I'm pretty sure even sighted users don't see this.
    Fixes #1446.
