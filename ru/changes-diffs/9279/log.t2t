    In Windows 7 and later, no longer inappropriately announce  speech recognition and touch input as a keyboard language change.
    
    tsf.cpp: support ITfInputProcessorProfileActivationSink::OnActivated instead  of ITfActiveLanguageProfileNotifySink::OnActivated, making use of the extra arguments, which can clearly tell us if a profile is  keyboard or speech etc. Fall back to ITfActiveLanguageProfileNotifySink if ITfInputProcessorProfileActivationSink cannot be registered (this happens in XP).
