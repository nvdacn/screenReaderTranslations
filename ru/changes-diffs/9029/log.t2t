    Move support for the Chromium browser and its derivatives into the NVDAObjects package so that it is supported wherever it is encountered.
    The app module for Google Chrome and the app modules for several derivative browsers are no longer required.
    More importantly, this means the Chromium Embedded Framework is now supported.
    Fixes #3108.
