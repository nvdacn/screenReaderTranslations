    Fix for #2750 - Quick nav to buttons and form fields will now locate links marked as buttons using an ARIA role of button, in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls.
    
    MSHTML quick nav for button and formField no longer require MSAA state of focusable, and the MSHTML backend now hardcodes an element's MSAA accRole to button if it has an ARIA role of button.
