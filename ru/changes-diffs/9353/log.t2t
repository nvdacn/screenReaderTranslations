    Outlook 2010 auto completes now work due to now using MSAA, not UIA in this situation. Fixes #2816
    
    Specifically: UIAHandler: treet a window with a class of NetUIHWND who's root window's class is Net UI Tool Window, as having a bad UIA implementation (we will fallback to IAccessible).
    At the same time, slightly restructure UIAHandler.handler.isUIAWindow moving the choice logic in to a new _isUIAWindowHelper function, so as to not get confused by the outer cashing code.
