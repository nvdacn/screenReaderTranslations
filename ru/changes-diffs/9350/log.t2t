    If the Add-ons Manager is already open, activating it again (either from the Tools menu or by opening an add-on file) no longer fails or makes it impossible to close the Add-ons Manager. Fixes #3351.
    
    AddonsDialog was already a singleton, but the constructor was being called even when there was already an instance, which was causing all sorts of breakage.
    Re #3351.
