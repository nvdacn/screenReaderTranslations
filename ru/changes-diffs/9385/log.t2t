    Correctly detect next selected slide when deleting a slide in PowerPoint's thumbnails view. Fixes #3415.
    
    Specifically:
     * bind documentwindow's selectionChange script to delete and backspace.
     * Slide NVDAObject's name property: catch COMError when fetching slideNumber (this was already done for title)
