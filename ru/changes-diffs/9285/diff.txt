-
-== Bug Fixes ==
-- Activating an object now announces the action before the activation, rather than the action after the activation (e.g. expand when expanding rather than collapse). (#2982)

-- In the Skype recent conversations list, the number of new events is now read for each conversation if relevant. (#1446)

-- quick navigation to buttons and form fields will now locate links marked as buttons for accessibility purposes in Internet Explorer. (#2750)
