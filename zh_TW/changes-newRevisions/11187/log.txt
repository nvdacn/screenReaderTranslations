    Fix garbled text when typing in Outlook with braille enabled and with text expansion functionality (e.g. in AutoHotkey).
    
    InputGesture.execute: if an intercepted command script (script that sends the gesture it intercepts) is queued and or has not yet completed its execution, queue any further gestures that do not have a script via a fake script that just sends the gesture. this ensures that input stays in order even if it was delayed by NVDA.
    Fixes #2953, #4499.
