- The new audioDucking.AudioDucker class allows code which outputs audio to indicate when background audio should be ducked. (#3830)
- nvwave.WavePlayer's constructor now has a wantDucking keyword argument which specifies whether background audio should be ducked while audio is playing. (#3830)
 - When this is enabled (which is the default), it is essential that WavePlayer.idle be called when appropriate.
+{- Enhanced I/O for braille displays: (#5609)
 - Thread-safe braille display drivers can declare themselves as such using the BrailleDisplayDriver.isThreadSafe attribute. A driver must be thread-safe to benefit from the following features.
 - Data is written to thread-safe braille display drivers in the background, thus improving performance.
 - hwIo.Serial extends pyserial to call a callable when data is received instead of drivers having to poll.
 - hwIo.Hid provides support for braille displays communicating via USB HID.
 - hwPortUtils and hwIo can optionally provide detailed debug logging, including devices found and all data sent and received.}+
