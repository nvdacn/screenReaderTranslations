    In Google Chrome and Chrome-based browsers, certain chunks of text (such as those with emphasis) are no longer repeated when reporting the text of an alert or dialog.
    
    This occurred because getDialogText uses text leaf nodes, but text leaf nodes in Chrome include their text in both accName and IAccessibleText.
    getDialogText now assumes the name is always part of the text for static text objects.
    Fixes #4066.
