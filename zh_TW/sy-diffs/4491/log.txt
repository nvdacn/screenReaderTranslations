  English symbols:
  	* Preserve colon if not replacing. In practical terms, this means that times will be spoken correctly at levels none and some.
  	* Move currency symbols to level all and preserve them if not replacing. This means that currency speaking will be handled by the synth at levels below all.
  	* Add a rule to handle negative numbers at level none.
