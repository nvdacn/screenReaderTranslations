 - On a touch screen, performing a single finger flick left or right when in object mode now moves previous or next through all objects, not just those in the current container.

 - Flat review has been replaced with object, document and screen review modes. (#2996)
  - Object review reviews text just within the navigator object, document review reviews all text in a browse mode document (if any) and screen review reviews text on the screen for the current application.

  - The navigator object automatically follows the review cursor such that it remains the deepest object at the position of the review cursor when in document or screen review modes.
  - After switching to screen review mode, NVDA will stay in this mode until you explicitly switch back to document or object review mode.
  - When in document or object review mode, NVDA may automatically switch between these two modes depending on whether you are moving around a browse mode document or not.
