    In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, moving to specific heading levels with single letter navigation now behaves as expected when the level of a heading is overridden for accessibility purposes (specifically, when aria-level overrides the level of an h tag).
    
    Specifically:
    
    * In the value lists  in the IterNodesByAttribs search dictionaries, None can now be included along side other values. I.e. Matches on these values or the absents of the attribute all together. Previously None could only be used by itself.
    * When quick nav searching for a specific heading level, only match on a specific heading level tag if it does not have an aria-level.
    
    Fixes #5434.
