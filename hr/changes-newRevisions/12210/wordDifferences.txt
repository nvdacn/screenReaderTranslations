== Changes ==
- NVDA now reports colors using a basic well-understood set of 9 color hues and 3 shades, with brightness and paleness variations. This is rather than using more subjective and less understood color names. (#6029)

+{- The existing NVDA+F9 then NVDA+F10 behaviour has been modified to select text on the first press of F10. When F10 is presed twice (in quick succession) the text is copied to the clipboard. (#4636)}+

== Bug Fixes ==
- In browse mode in Microsoft Word, copying to the clipboard now preserves formatting. (#5956)
