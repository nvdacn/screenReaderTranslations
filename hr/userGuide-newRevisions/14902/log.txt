    Object coordinates: It is now possible to hear object coordinates when using object navigation commands. re #2559 (#6078)
    
    * Object coordinates: It is now possible to hear object coordinates when using object navigation commands (rebased with master in June 2016). re #2559
    
    * NVDAObjects: obj coordinate announcement will be handled via becomeNavObj event. re #2559
    
    As object coordinate announcement will be done regardless of focus movement, it was decided to let becomeNavObject event call call object coordinate player function in screen explorer. This means global commands will not use this method (this decisoin was made after talking to Jamie Teh and others).
    
    * Object coordinates: obj coordinates checkbox now follows guiHelper services. re #2559
    
    * Object coordinates: updated copyright headers, removed unused imports.
    
    * Config: play obj coordinates validator now lives in the new config spec module (after rebasing with master). re #2559.
    
    * Object coordinates: applied multi-monitor fix from NVDA 2017.1. re #2559.
    
    In NVDA 2017.1, it is possible to hear mouse coordinates on multi-monitor systems. Thus object coordinate announcement function has been modified to take advantage of this. To ensure backward compatibility, minimum screen position paremeter will be a keyword argument, ready to become mandatory if obj coordinate announcement from multi-monitor set ups is desired.
    
    * Object coordinates: do not play the tone if the object ia offscreen. re #2559
    
    * User guide: add anchors for object coordinate checkbox. re #2559
    
    * Update copyright years
    
    * Object coordinates: do not detect brightness, copyright year update. Re #2559.
    
    Reviewed by Mick Curran (NV Access)L due to some issues, object brightness won't make sense when playing coordinates, so tell coordinates player function to ignore this.
    Also updated copyright year.
    
    * Mouse handler: update copyright years
    
    * Mouse handler: set copyright header to that of NVDA 2018.2 (to be changed in 2018.3)
    
    * Mouse handler: restore removed imports.
