- Current NVDA version
- Operating System version
- Whether the Operating System is 64 or 32 bit

Note that although your IP address will be used to calculate your country during the update check, the IP address is never kept.
Apart from the mandatory information required to check for updates, the following extra information is also currently sent:
- NVDA interface language
- Whether this copy of NVDA is portable or installed
- Name of the current speech synthesizer in use (including the name of the add-on the driver comes from)
