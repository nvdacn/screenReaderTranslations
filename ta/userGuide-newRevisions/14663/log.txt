    Change multiple settings dialogs into one category based dialog (#7302)
    
    * Implement a categories based settings dialog for configuration manager settings. This fixes #577. The following is changed:
    
    1. Added new classes:
    	* MultiCategorySettingsDialog
    	* NVDASettingsDialog
    	* SettingsPanel
    
    2. Changed several settings dialogs to be settings panels, and included them in the new NVDASettingsDialog
    3. Added an apply button to the new dialog, and added the possibility to add these to other settings dialogs as well
    4. Added control+tab and control+shift+tab keyboard commands to switch between the various settings categories
    5. Added the possibility to easily override the orientation of the settings sizer in settings dialogs, since the settings sizer needs to be horizontal in a multi category dialog
    6. Changed several doc strings and translator comments to reflect the new situation
    7. Updated gui/__init__.py to reflect the new situation
    
    * Updated global commands for the new settings dialog, and removed some unintentional double space in this file
    
    * Show the edited profile in the NVDA settings title bar. Fixes #3644
    
    * Changed CONTROL+Tab code to use the % operator
    
    * Fix merge conflict and convert OCR dialog to panel
    
    * Fixed major crash when shutting down NVDA with the new settings dialog open
    
    * Review actions
    
    * Use wx GridbagSizer for the multi category settings dialog.
    
    This allows the categories treeview to be vertically aligned with the
    settings panel.
    
    Gave the settings panel a fixed size, and introduced a scrolling panel
    which will display a scroll bar when this size is exceeded.
    
    Removed the scrolling panel from the document formatting
    
    * Review actions
    
    For https://github.com/BabbageCom/nvda/pull/1
    Removed unneeded sizers.
    
    * Review actions regarding voice settings panel updates
    
    * more review actions regarding synthesizer changes
    
    * Fix wx warning and GUI stutter when loading
    
    There was a warning to do with the span used. The span should be
    (rowspan, colspan) where (1,1) is a single cell.
    
    There was a stutter when changing to certain (more complicated) settings
    panels. For instance the Braille settings or the document formatting
    settings. Calling `Freeze` and then `Thaw` addresses this.
    
    * Don't prompt the user to save a new synthesizer, just try to load when deactivating the panel
    
    * Split synthDriverHandler.setSynth into a new getSynthInstance method
    
    * Change TouchInteractionDialog into a panel
    
    * Combine voice and synth settings
    
    Both are added to a single panel called Speech
    
    * Review actions
    
    * Don't allow more than one instance of the synthesizer dialog
    
    * allowMultiInstance doc string
    
    * When a settings dialog is open, only allow the synthesizer selection dialog to open when initiated from the speech panel
    
    * Add BrailleDisplaySelection dialog
    
    * Rename onVoiceCommand to onSpeechCommand
    
    * Some reordering of super calls and clean ups
    
    * Proper focus when changing tabs with ctrl+tab
    
    * Put grouping around settings
    
    * Make return close the dialog, also when the tree is focused
    
    * Properly update current display and synth in the dialog when changing
    
    * Place display and synth in a static text, which is properly set as the description for the grouping
    
    * Update several GlobalCommands
    
    * Fix selection dialogs being destroyed even when there was an error in selecting a driver
    
    * Rename BrailleIoSettingsPanel to BrailleSettingsSubPanel
    
    * Translator comments, also call Layout on the panel when SetupScrolling is called to fix a bug in the braille panel
    
    * Accelerators, small regression fix when closing the dialog with escape
    
    * Very small, trivial change
    
    * Fix global commands backwards compat
    
    * More fixes to globalCommands backwards compatibility
    
    * User guide updates
    
    * Renamed and fixed some commands, thereby preserving backwards compatibility for scripts. Added NVDA+ctrl+a to braille display selection dialog
    
    * Make sure that opening unsupported panels is handled gracefully
    
    * Add select braille display gesture to user guide
    
    * Fix error when opening settings
    
    When opening settings with NVDA+n, p, s there is no longer an error.
    Improved the logging to make it easier to track down the cause of an
    error like this.
    
    * Fix dialog launching without a category
    
    * Revert reordering of call to super
    
    * app module to detect category changes
    
    Use the NVDA app module to detect changes to the name of the current
    category in the muilti category settings dialog. This replaces the group
    box around each settings panel. The groupbox added extra verbosity, and
    was visually unappealing.
    
    * Make sure that we set the label on the container as early as possible
    
    * Change multi category settings tree view into a list control
    
    * Hopefully fixed name changes not being announced for the container when the braille panel gets focus.
    
    * Preserve the category selection when pressing apply
    
    * Add one column to the categories list, as it is required to show up correctly
    
    * For onOk and onCancel, just destroy the panels without explicitly removing them from the list of panels. That list will be destroyed anyway. Also split a very long line into several ones.
    
    * Add missing translator comments
    
    * Use read-only text controls for synthesizer and braille display
    
    * Add more debug logging to the gui, which can be enabled with config.conf['debugLog']['gui']=True
    
    * Add more logging to the loading of the braille settings subpanel
    
    * Lazy init the settings panels (babbagecom/nvda#4)
    
    * Lazy init the settings panels
    
    * Use wx.ListItem Id to lookup panels
    
    Also fixed save / discard / apply
    
    * Clean up panel instance lists.
    
    * Review actions
    
    * Remove colon from groupings
    
    The synthesizer and braille display groupings do not need a colon.
    
    * KeyError should be IndexError
    
    When looking up an index on a list that does not exist.
    
    * Change accelerators for change buttons, update several copyright years
    
    * Announce editing profile changes when switching categories, if applicable
    
    * Work around announcement of initial category when undesired
    
    * Fix verbose announcement of config profile changes in the multi category settings dialog
    
    * Changes in preparation for display auto detection
    
    * Make the Multi Cat settings dialog resizable.
    
    When windows scaling is applied, the dialog is not big enough and was
    showing horizontal scroll bars. To remedy this the dialog has been made
    resizeable.
    
    * Populate the settings panel during makeSettings
    
    Rather than construct an empty settings panel and then update it
    (indirectly) via postInit when setting the selected category and
    relying on the listCtrl's event item focused binding, we explicitly
    construct it in make settings and save the method that should be used to
    set focus when postInit is called.
    
    * fix some spelling errors
    
    * Fix an error when changing profile.
    
    * Make configuration of SettingsDialog construction consistent
    
    resizable, hasApplyButton, and settingsSizerOrientation parameters are
    only used in the construction of the SettingsDialog, so they have been
    made __init__ params.
    
    * Make dialog title an unicode string
    
    * Do not call super for onSave on the TouchInteractionPanel
    
    * Fix case where using a category specific gesture to open the settings dialog did not properly focus the selected category in the categories list
    
    * Reload the synthesizer when pressing ok in the synthesizer selection dialog, just as we did before
    
    * No longer ignore the first occuring change of the currently edited profile
    
    * Use windows apis to get the scaling factor for highdpi settings.
    
    This is then used to set initial sizes in the dialogs.
    
    * Clean up some comments
    
    * Fix comments further.
    
    * Review actions
    
    * add better logging
    
    * Fix undersized synth/braille text boxes on scaled systems
