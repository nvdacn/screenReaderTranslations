+ Getting 
+{and Setting Up}+
 NVDA +
If you have not yet got a copy of NVDA, you can download it from [www.nvda-project.org NVDA_URL].

Go to the download section and you will find a link to download the latest version of NVDA.


-{There are currently two ways NVDA is packaged.
One is an Installer which}-









































+{Running the file you have just downloaded}+
 will 
-{talk}-
 
+{start a temporary copy of NVDA, and also ask}+
 you 
-{through installing}-
 
+{if you want to install NVDA, create a portable copy, or just continue using the temporary copy.

If you plan to  always use}+
 NVDA 
-{so that}-
 
+{on this computer,}+
 you 
-{can then run}-
 
+{will want to choose to install NVDA.
Installing NVDA will allow for such things as  having}+
 it 
-{at any time}-
 
+{automatically start after logon, it will be able to read the Windows Logon and Windows security screens (something that the portable and temporary copies cannot do), and it will be accessible}+
 from the Start 
-{Menu.}-
 
+{Menu and from a desktop shortcut.}+

The 
-{other}-
 
+{installed copy}+
 is 
+{also able to create}+
 a 
-{self-extracting archive file that contains a fully}-
 portable 
-{version of NVDA, which}-
 
+{copy itself at any time.

If}+
 you 
-{can run from anywhere, including}-
 
+{want to take NVDA with you on}+
 a USB 
-{thumb}-
 
+{thum}+
 drive or 
-{CD.

In order to access the Windows logon screen, User Account Control (UAC) screen or}-
 other 
-{secure Windows screens, as well as applications running as administrator in Windows Vista and later,}-
 
+{portable media, then}+
 you 
-{must}-
  
+{should choose to create a portable copy.
The portable copy also has the ability to}+
 install 
-{NVDA}-
 
+{itself}+
 on 
-{your system using the installer.
These screens cannot be accessed using}-
 
+{any computer at}+
 a 
-{portable}-
 
+{later time.
  
Using the temporary}+
 copy of 
-{NVDA.

+ Installing}-
 NVDA 
-{+}-
 
+{is also an option, certainly for demonstration purposes, though  starting NVDA in this way each time can become very time consuming.}+
