    * Theoretically support SyncBraille
    
    * Automatically force syncBraille drivers to the new native driver for a smooth upgrade
    
    * Sanity fix, line length
    
    * Merge Sync Braille and Hims sections in the user guide and remove dependencies from readme
    
    * Up to date bulk implementation from @bramd
    
    * Add many more gestures to the map, and improved map layout
    
    * Increase onReceiveSize and some detection changes and sanity fixes.
    
    * Update user guide and add previous/next line commands
    
    * Migrate syncBraille users to the new driver
    
    * Add SyncBraille to model map, add extra debugging statement
    
    * Add bluetoothPrefix to base model class
