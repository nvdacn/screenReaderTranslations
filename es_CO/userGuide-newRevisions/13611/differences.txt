+++ Braille Input ++
+NVDA supports entry of both uncontracted and contracted braille via a braille keyboard.
+You can select the translation table used to translate braille into text using the [Input table #BrailleInputTable] setting in the Braille Settings dialog.
+
+When uncontracted braille is being used, text is inserted as soon as it is entered.
+When using contracted braille, text is inserted when you press space or enter at the end of a word.
+Note that translation can only reflect the braille word you are typing and cannot consider existing text.
+For example, if you are using a braille code that begins numbers with a number sign and you press backspace to move to the end of a number, you will need to type the number sign again to enter additional numbers.
