    Native driver for Optelec ALVA 6 displays with support for raw braille input and the Optelec protocool converter (#7884)
    
    * New, native driver for ALVA 6 series displays. The new alva driver replaces the alvaBC6 driver. This new driver supports raw keyboard input, time synchronisation and properly updates the number of cells for split point changes.
    
    * Made it more clear in the user guide that by default, ALVA uses its own braille input system
    
    * Add an additional note to the user guide about Bluetooth pairing
    
    * Fix typo
