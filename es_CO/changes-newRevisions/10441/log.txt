    Serious problems with editable text controls in dialogs in recent versions of Eclipse have been fixed.
    
    If IAccessible2 has been implemented, don't try to use Window level classes. This prevents inheritance conflicts for mix-ins such as EditableText. If IA2 has been implemented, it should be superior anyway. Where this isn't the case, this can be worked around in app modules, etc.
    Fixes #3872.
