message:
  When disabling automatic checking for updates, NVDA no longer has to be restarted in order for the change to fully take effect.
  Previously, updateCheck.terminate() tried to dispose of autoChecker, but the timer creates a circular reference, so it would still run for the next check. The timer needs to be explicitly discarded to prevent this.
