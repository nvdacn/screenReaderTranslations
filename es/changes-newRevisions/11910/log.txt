    In browse mode, when attempting to use single letter navigation to move to an element which isn't supported for the document, NVDA reports that this isn't supported rather than reporting that there is no element in that direction.
    
    _iterNodesByType now always raises NotImplementedError when a type is not supported.
    Re #5691.
