    Enhanced I/O for braille displays:
    
    * hwIo.Serial extends pyserial to call a callable when data is received instead of drivers having to poll every 50 ms.
    * Data is written to thread-safe braille display drivers in the background, thus avoiding blocking the main thread.
    * hwIo.Hid provides support for braille displays communicating via USB HID.
