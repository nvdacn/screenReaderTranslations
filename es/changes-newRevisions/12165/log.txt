    Strikethrough and double-strikethrough are now reported if appropriate in Microsoft Word.
    
    * Speech: add support for double strikethrough (strikethrough=double). Any other True value would be just strikethrough.
    * NVDAHelper winword support: add support for strikethrough and double strikethrough.
    
    Fixes #5800.
