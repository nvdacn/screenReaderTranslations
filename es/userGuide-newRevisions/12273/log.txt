    Improve support for the Alva BC6 braille displays (#5493)
    
    * Alva BC6: Add more key bindings.
    
    * Alva BC6: Add detection of secondary cursor routing buttons, currently unassigned.
    These are virtual buttons that are triggered by a long-press of the cursor routing buttons.
    For backwards compatibility the original name, routing, is still used for the primary action.
    
    * Alva BC6: Update user documentation.
    
    * Alva BC6: Add two more bindings for controlling the cursor shape and state. Requires #5198.
    
    * Alva BC6: Use the new braille_toFocus script. Requires #5250.
    
    * Improve command names for the BC6 in the user guide.
