    In NVDA's Mouse Settings dialog, keyboard shortcuts have been added for play audio coordinates when mouse moves and brightness controls audio coordinates volume.
    
    Also capitalized those first letters as they weren't before, which was inconsistent with the other options in this window.
    Fixes #4916.
