    In Microsoft Office 2010 Options dialogs, the labels of combo boxes are reported correctly.
    
    These seem to be exposed correctly by MSAA, but not by UIA. This suggests the UIA implementation is once again broken, so I've disabled it for controls in these dialogs. Hopefully, this won't break something else.
    Fixes #4056.
