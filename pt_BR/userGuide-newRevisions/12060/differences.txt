+==== Play sound for spelling errors while typing ====
+When enabled, a short buzzer sound will be played when a word you type contains a spelling error.
+This option is only available if reporting of spelling errors is enabled in NVDA's [Document Formatting Settings #DocumentFormattingSettings] dialog.
+
 ==== Handle keys from other applications ====
 This option allows the user to control if key presses generated by applications such as on-screen keyboards and speech recognition software should be processed by NVDA. 
 This option is on by default, though certain users may wish to turn this off, such as those typing Vietnamese with the Unikey typing software as it will  cause incorrect character input.
