++ Papenmeier BRAILLEX Newer Models ++
The following Braille displays are supported: 
- BRAILLEX EL 40c, EL 80c, EL 20c, EL 60c (USB)
- BRAILLEX EL 40s, EL 80s, EL 2d80s, EL 70s, EL 66s (USB)
- BRAILLEX Trio (USB and bluetooth)
-

If BrxCom is installed, NVDA will use BrxCom.
BrxCom is a tool that allows you to use the Braille input independently from a screen reader.
A new version of BrxCom which works with NVDA will be released by Papenmeier soon.  

Most devices have an Easy Access Bar (EAB) that allows intuitive and fast operation.
The EAB can be moved in four directions where generally each direction has two switches.
The c-series is the only exception to this rule.

The c-series and some other displays have two routing rows whereby the upper row is used to report formatting information.
Holding one of the upper routing keys and pressing the EAB on c-series devices emulates the second switch state.
Pressing and holding the up, down, right and left keys (or EAB) causes the corresponding action to be repeated.

Generally, the following keys are available on these braille displays:
|| Name | Key |
| l1 | Left front key |
| l2 | Left rear key |
| r1 | Right front key |
| r2 | Right rear key |
| up | 1 Step up |
| up2 | 2 Steps up |
| left | 1 Step left |
| left2 | 2 Steps left |
| right | 1 Step right |
| right2 | 2 Steps right |
| dn | 1 Step down |
| dn2 | 2 Steps down |

Following are the Papenmeier command assignments for NVDA:
%kc:beginInclude
|| Name | Key |

[BRLTTY http://mielke.cc/brltty/] is a separate program which can be used to support many more braille displays.
In order to use this, you need to install [BRLTTY for Windows http://brl.thefreecat.org/brltty/].
