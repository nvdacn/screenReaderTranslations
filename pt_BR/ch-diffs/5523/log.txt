message:
  Report position info (e.g. 1 of 4) for UIAutomation controls that support the ItemIndex and ItemCount custom properties. this includes Windows Explorer list items in Windows 7 and above. Note that as the needed interfaces and types are not bundled into the UIAutomation client typeLibrary, a utility function for registering UIA properties has been added to nvdahelper local to save having to define all the interfaces and types in Python.
