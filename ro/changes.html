<H2>2016.2</H2>

<H3>New Features</H3>

<UL>
<LI>In browse mode in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, using first letter navigation to move by annotation (a and shift+a) now moves to inserted and deleted text. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/5691">#5691</A>)
<LI>In Microsoft Excel, NVDA now reports the level of a group of cells, as well as whether it is collapsed or expanded. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/5690">#5690</A>)
<LI>Pressing the Report text formatting command twice presents the information in browse mode so it can be reviewed. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/4908">#4908</A>)
<LI>In Microsoft Excel 2010 and later, cell shading and gradient fill is now reported. Automatic reporting is controlled by the Report colors option in NVDA's Document Formatting preferences. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/3683">#3683</A>)
</UL>

<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>In browse mode, when attempting to use single letter navigation to move to an element which isn't supported for the document, NVDA reports that this isn't supported rather than reporting that there is no element in that direction. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/5691">#5691</A>)
<LI>When listing sheets in the Elements List in Microsoft Excel, sheets containing only charts are now included. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/5698">#5698</A>)
<LI>NVDA no longer reports extraneous information when switching windows in a Java application with multiple windows such as IntelliJ or Android Studio. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/5732">#5732</A>)
</UL>

<H3>Changes for Developers</H3>

<UL>
<LI>NVDA's C++ components are now built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/5592">#5592</A>)
<LI>You can now present a text or HTML message to the user in browse mode using ui.browseableMessage. (<A HREF="http://community.nvda-project.org/ticket/4908">#4908</A>)
