    Support for Windows OneCore voices included in Windows 10. (PR #7110, issue #6159)
    
    This uses a C++/CX dll to access the UWP SpeechSynthesizer class. There are other UWP APIs we might like to access in future (e.g. OCR), so rather than making this dll specific to OneCore speech, it's called nvdaHelperLocalWin10. The build system for this dll makes it easy to add other components in future.
    In addition, this required code to generate balanced XML from an NVDA speech sequence. Although we use SSML for eSpeak, eSpeak happily accepts unbalanced (malformed) XML. OneCore speech does not. This code is in the speechXml module. This might eventually be reused to replace the ugly balanced XML code in the SAPI5 driver.
    
    Note that NVDA can no longer be built with Visual Studio 2015 Express. You must use Visual Studio 2015 Community, as you also need the Windows 10 Tools and SDK. See the updated dependencies in the readme for details.
    Also, we now bundle the VC 2015 runtime, as some systems don't have it and it is needed for OneCore Speech.
