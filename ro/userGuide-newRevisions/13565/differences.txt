+Auto-suggestions are lists of suggested entries based on text entered into certain edit fields and documents.
+For example, when you enter text into the search box in Start menu in Windows Vista and later, Windows displays a list of suggestions based on what you typed.
+For some edit fields such as search fields in various Windows 10 apps, NVDA can notify you that a list of suggestions has appeared when you type text.
