message:
  When updating a previously installed copy of NVDA, the desktop shortcut key is no longer forced back to control+alt+n as it many have been manually changed by the user. The checkbox in the installer which asks if the shortcut should be created is also renamed to "Keep existing shortcut" in this situation to reflect this. Fixes #2572.
