message:
  The percentage that the pitch changes when a capital letter is spoken is now configurable from the Voice Settings dialog. Fixes #255.
  This new edit field takes a value between -100 and 100. This edit field replaces the older raise pitch for capitals checkbox, therefore if you wish to disable pitch changes you must specify a value of 0.
