message:
  Braille: allow flat review to be seen with Braille while tethered to review, fixes #1711, and stop showing an object's value if its showing its text (for instance stops the whole document being shown twice in Wordpad documents).
   Specific changes:
  	* move logic that works out if braille should provide a review TextInfo region in to its own NVDAObjectHasUsefulText function in the braille module. Eventually we may want to share this kind of logic with speech, but for now this is okay.
  	*  braille.NVDAObjectHasUsefulText: if the object's TextInfo is a displayModel textInfo, then this should be treated as useful text. 
  	* Use the new NVDAObjectHasusefulText function also  when generating braille for an NVDAObject with getBrailleTextForProperties, by only using obj.value if NVDAObjectHasUsefulText is false.
