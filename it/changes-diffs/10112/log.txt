    Update to liblouis 2.5.4.
    
    The submodule URL has changed and it also references a commit which isn't in a branch, so if you have a git checkout, you'll need to run:
    1. git submodule sync
    2. cd include\liblouis
    3. git fetch -t
    4. cd ..\..
    5. git submodule update
    
    Fixes #4103.
