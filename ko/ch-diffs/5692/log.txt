message:
  Support for StretchBlt in the display model code. This allows NVDA to see tab labels in DropBox's preferences dialog, and perhaps other things.
  Specifically:
  * DisplayModel_t::copyRectangle: rather than only taking x and y coordinates for the destination, take a complete destination rectangle instead.
  * DisplayModel_t::copyRectangle: Apart from shifting (transposing) coordinates of copied chunks to be positioned in the destination rectangle, also scale all the coordinates so that the chunk is now the correct size relative to the destination rectangle.
    *GDIHooks: split out most of the BitBlt code into a helper function so it can be used also by a hook for StretchBlt.
  *GDIHooks: hook StretchBlt.
