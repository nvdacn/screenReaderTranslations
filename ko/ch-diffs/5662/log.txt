message:
  Fixes for candidate list support in Chinese Simplified Pinyin input method under Windows 7:
  	* Don't allow arrowing up and down to the next/previous buttons, only the candidates themselves.
  	* Automatically report candidates each time the page changes such as with left and right arrows, and also when first opening with Home.
