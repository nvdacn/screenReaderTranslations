    - 'i6101_SymbolsListCtrl'
    - 'i6348-documentFormattingDialog'
    - 'fixGuiAlignmentIssues'
    
    Adjust the symbols list. See PR #6339
    
        Put the 'symbol' label above the list and have the list itself take up
        the full width of the dialog. Columns are spaced automatically, with one
        nominated to take up any extra available room.
    
        The first column was selected to expand more, as the information in the
        other columns can be viewed in the "change symbol" group.
    
        Fixes #6101
    
    Restructure the document formatting dialog. See PR #6402
    
        The document formatting settings dialog is restructured so that items
        can no longer "disappear" off the screen. The options are now in a
        scrolling section, grouped for clarity (paritcularly for new users /
        sighted users). A dialog description has been added, for further
        clarity.
    
        Fixes #6348
    
    Fix Gui Alignment issues. See PR #6287
    
        Fixes up various alignment and padding problems in the GUI.
        Introduces a new helper to abstract some of these details.
    
        Fixes #6317 (Gestures treeview does not look like a treeview)
        Fixes #5548 (Text control to specify the path when creating a portable copy is quite narrow)
        Fixes #6342 (Spacing between labels and combo boxes)
        Fixes #6343 (Inconsistency with vertical spacing between checkbox/label options)
        Fixes #6349 (input gestures dialog tree view too small)
