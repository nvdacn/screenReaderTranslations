    In browse mode in Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, the correct content is now reported when an element appears or changes and is immediately focused.
    
    MSHTML vbufBackend: force an instant update of the content  for onfocus events in case the focus moves to something that was newly created/changed.
    Fixes #5040.
