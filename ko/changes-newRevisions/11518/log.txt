    Support for editing of rich text in Mozilla applications such as Google Docs with braille support enabled in Mozilla Firefox and HTML composition in Mozilla Thunderbird.
    
    Other technical changes worth noting:
    * Remove TextInfo.getEmbeddedObject and NVDAObject.embeddingTextInfo. These were only ever used by IA2, and even then, they differed depending on the implementation.
    * nvdaHelperRemote: Introduce execInWindow to simplify/unify execution of code within the thread of a given window from an RPC call.
    * IAccessible NVDAObject: IA2 windowHandle and states are now cached to make equality checks faster.
    
    Fixes #1668.
