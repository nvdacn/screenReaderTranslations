message:
  Added another input composition option: always include a short character description for candidates. If on, a short character description (specifically the first) will be included in the candidate's name (i.e. will be spoken both for auto candidate list reading and for candidate selection changes). The rest of the character descriptions (if any) are still announced as the description on selection changes whether or not this option is on or off. These short character descriptions are provided for each character in a candidate, at the position of the candidate, rather than at the end. This option may be useful for both Krean and Japanese.
