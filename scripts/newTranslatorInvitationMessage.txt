Dear <name>,

Thanks for volunteering to help with the maintenance of the <languageName> localization of NVDA.
Please find inclosed invitation to create an account on assembla, so that you can submit your work.

If you have any questions or need clarification of the process, or need guidance, please do not hesitate to ask for help on the translation list.
We sometimes do a initial skype call to help new translators get started, we can do that if you feel it will be helpful.
Thanks and welcome to the team.
