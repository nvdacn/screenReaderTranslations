    Merge branch 't3485' (Poedit 1.5.7 changes).
    
    It seems that when this was merged, some of the later commits were accidentally missed, including the fix for the Report notes for translators command.
    Translators, please note that this merge introduces some minor changes to translatable strings for Poedit and the User Guide.
    Fixes #3485. For real this time.
