[[!meta title="Information on mailing list"]]

NVDA is an international effort and there are users around the world.
A number of mailing lists (both international and language specific) exists so you can meet other NVDA users around the world, ask questions and help other users.
If you know some English, we recommend joining the international lists, since it is more likely that you will get a quicker answer.
If you join your local mailing list, you can ask your questions and any reply will be in your language.
You are more likely to find people living near you who can meet you in person or talk with you over the phone to help you get started with NVDA.
