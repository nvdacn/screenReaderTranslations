"Once you press Open or press ENTER on the add-on file, NVDA will ask if you "
"really wish to install the add-on.  As the functionality of add-ons is "
"unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your "
"personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is "
"very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.  Once the add-"
