"Alternatively, if you installed 2012.3 or later on your computer, using file "

"press Open or press ENTER on the add-on file, NVDA will ask if you really "
"wish to install the add-on.  As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted "
"inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or "
"even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to "
"only install add-ons from sources you trust.  Once the add-on is installed, "
"NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running."
