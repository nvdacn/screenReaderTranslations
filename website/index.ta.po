"[NVDA][1] is a very flexible and extensible screen reader.  NVDA add-ons are "
"additional packages that can be downloaded and installed into your copy of "
"NVDA to enhance existing functionality or add additional features.  These "
"add-ons may include additional features and commands that can be used "
"everywhere, enhancing support for a program, or add support for a new "
"braille display or a speech synthesizer."

"On these pages, you will find add-ons that have been created and publicly "
"reviewed by members of the community.  Please note that many of these add-"
"ons are not provided by NV Access, so NV Access cannot be held responsible "
"for these add-ons."

"To install an add-on, go to the NVDA tools menu, then select manage add-"
"ons.  Then select install, navigate to the location where you saved the "
"downloaded add-on and choose the add-on package you wish to install.  "
"Alternatively, if you installed NVDA 2012.3 or later on your computer, using "
"file manager of your choice, navigate to the location where you stored the "
"add-on, then press ENTER on the nvda-add-on file you wish to install."

"Once you press Open or press ENTER on the add-on file, NVDA will ask if you "
"really wish to install the add-on.  As the functionality of add-ons is "
"unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your "
"personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is "
"very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.  Once the add-"
"on is installed, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running."

"If you want to have your add-on listed on this website, please subscribe to "
"[NVDA Add-ons Central mailing list][2] and request a community review.  A "
"member of the community will then review your add-on, and if it passes basic "
"review such as license and usability, your add-on will be made available on "
"this website."
