"[NVDA][1] is a very flexible and extensible screen reader.  NVDA add-ons are "
"additional packages that can be downloaded and installed into your copy of "
"NVDA to enhance existing functionality or add additional features.  On these "
"pages, you will find add-ons that have been created and publicly reviewed by "
"members of the community.  Please note that many of these add-ons are not "
"provided by NV Access, so NV Access cannot be held responsible for these add-"
"ons,"

"To install an add-on, go to the NVDA tools menu, then select manage add-"
"ons.  Then select install, navigate to the location where you saved the "
"downloaded add-on and choose the add-on package you wish to install.  "
"Alternatively, if you installed 2012.3 or later on your computer, using file "
"manager of your choice, navigate to the location where you stored the add-"
"on, then press ENTER on the nvda-addon file you wish to install.  Once you "
"press Open or press ENTER on the add-on file, NVDA will ask if you really "
"wish to install the add-on.  As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted "
"inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or "
"even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to "
"only install add-ons from sources you trust.  Once the add-on is installed, "
"NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running."

"information for an existing add-on, please email the [NVDA development email "
"list][2].  Include the name of the add-on, a short description, its author, "
"the current version number, a web site (if any) and a URL from which it can "
"be downloaded.  Add-ons will be added at the discretion of the community "
"reviewers, considering factors such as quality, usefulness and interest from "
"the wider community.  Please be aware that this process may take some time."
