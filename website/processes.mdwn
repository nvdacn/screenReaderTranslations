## Acceptance ##
1. Developer writes addon 
2. Developer submits addon to the community 
3. Community considers the possibility of accepting the add-on, discussing its functionality at least for a week: 
    3.1. Check that the addon adds interesting/useful features. 
    3.2. Maybe can be merged with an existing addon or included in NVDA's core? 
4. If community considers addon to be useful, accept. Addon status is now dev. 

## Maintenance ##
5. Author continues the add-on development, according with improvements in NVDA's core, reviewers and users feedback, provided patches and other community add-ons. 
6. Author requests add-on revision at least two or four weeks before releasing a new major version. 
7. Reviewers and testers check the add-on doesn't contain harmful code and authorize to post on the add-ons website. 
8. Authors or reviewers can release maintainance versions of the add-on to update translations or fix critical issues, notifying add-on changes on [add-ons mailing list][1]. 

## Deletion ##
9. Authors and reviewers should remove add-ons which contain harmful code, or if they become unuseful, for instance when NVDA implements their functionality, notifying this on add-ons mailing list. 

## Notes ##
1. If the addon author is also a community reviewer, s/he can not be the community reviewer for his/her addon. 
2. Users can be considered reviewers when they provide significant feedback, such as reporting bugs, suggestions and so on. 
3. Code will be considered to be harmful when, but not only, can change, delete or copy system or external files without a clear and useful purpose, produces Internet connections without a justified reason, etc. 
4. NV Access, as a trust author, could bypass this process if needed. 
5. For addons, master branch is equivalent to NVDA next, i.e. considered 
for testing purposes. Stable branch is considered to have had some testing and should be relatively error free/ok to run on your system. 
6. Stable branch will receive translation updates if the add-on is translatable. 
7. Authors and reviewers are strongly encouraged to follow our [guidelines][2], to ensure the quality of community add-ons. 
8. If add-on authors can't continue a required work, they can be replaced by another maintainer three months after the first request.
