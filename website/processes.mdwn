## Addon author process ##

1. Developer writes addon
2. Developer submits addon to community

13. Author continues, adds extra features on master or topic branches, goto 6.


## Process for community reviewer ##

1. Community reviewer checks strings and readme a final time.
2. Community reviewer makes stable branch, bump version.
3. Copy readme.md to srt/website/addon/addonName.mdwn
4. Run mr addon2settings
5. System provides strings from stable branch to translators
6. Translations are merged into stable branch by system, (every week).
7. If two weeks pass and there are no new translations, reviewer makes a release from stable branch.


Note 1: If the addon author is also a community reviewer, s/he can not be the community reviewer for his/her addon.

Note 2: For addons, master branch is equivalent to NVDA next, i.e. considered for testing purposes.
Stable branch is considered to have had some testing and should be relatively error free/ok to run on your system.
