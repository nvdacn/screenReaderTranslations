[[!meta title="Welcome to the NVDA Community Add-ons website"]]

[NVDA][1] is a very flexible and extensible screen reader.
NVDA add-ons are additional packages that can be downloaded and installed into your copy of NVDA to enhance existing functionality or add additional features.
On these pages, you will find add-ons that have been created and publicly reviewed by members of the community.
Please note that many of these add-ons are not provided by NV Access, so NV Access cannot be held responsible for these add-ons,

To install an add-on, go to the NVDA tools menu, then select manage add-ons. 
Then select install, navigate to the location where you saved the downloaded add-on and choose the add-on package you wish to install.
Alternatively, if you installed NVDA 2012.3 or later on your computer, using file manager of your choice, navigate to the location where you stored the add-on, then press ENTER on the nvda-addon file you wish to install.
Once you press Open or press ENTER on the add-on file, NVDA will ask if you really wish to install the add-on.
As the functionality of add-ons is unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.
Once the add-on is installed, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running. 

Please feel free to subscribe to the rss or atom feeds to be informed on when new addons or a new version of an addon is made available.
