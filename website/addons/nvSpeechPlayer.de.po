"NV Speech Player is a free and open-source prototype speech synthesizer that "
"can be used by NVDA. It generates speech using Klatt synthesis, making it "
"somewhat similar to speech synthesizers such as Dectalk and Eloquence."

"The 70s and 80s saw much research in speech synthesis. One of the most "
"prominent synthesis models that appeared was a formant-frequency synthesis "
"known as Klatt synthesis. Some well-known Klatt synthesizers are Dectalk and "
"Eloquence. They are well suited for use by the blind as they are extremely "
"responsive, their pronunciation is smooth and predictable, and they are "
"small in memory footprint. However, research soon moved onto other forms of "
"synthesis such as concatinative speech, as although this was slower, it was "
"much closer to the human voice. This was an advantage for usage in "
"mainstream applications such as GPS units or telephone systems, but not "
"necessarily so much of an advantage to the blind, who tend to care more "
"about responsiveness and predictability over prettiness."

"Although synthesizers such as Dectalk and Eloquence continued to be "
"maintained and available for nearly 20 years, now they are becoming harder "
"to get, with multiple companies saying that these, and their variants, have "
"been end-of-lifed and will not be updated anymore."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Concatinative synthesis is now starting to show promise as a replacement as "
"the responsiveness and smoothness is improving. However, most if not all of "
"the acceptable quality synthesizers are commercial and are rather expensive."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Both Dectalk and Eloquence were closed-source commercial products "
"themselves. However, there is a substantial amount of source code and "
"research material on Klatt synthesis available to the community. NV Speech "
"Player tries to take advantage of this by being a modern prototype of a "
"Klatt synthesizer, in the hopes to either be a replacement for synthesizers "
"like Dectalk or Eloquence, or at least restart research and conversation "
"around this synthesis method."

"The eSpeak synthesizer, itself a free and open-source product has proved "
"well as a replacement to a certain number of people in the community, but "
"many people who hear it are extremely quick to point out its \"metallic\" "
"sound and cannot seem to continue to use it. Although the authors of NV "
"Speech Player still prefer eSpeak as their synthesizer of choice, they would "
"still hope to try and understand better this strange resistance to eSpeak "
"which may have something to do with eSpeak's spectral frequency synthesis "
"verses Klatt synthesis. It may also have to do with the fact that consonants "
"are also gathered from recorded speech and can therefore be perceived as "
"being injected into the speech stream."
