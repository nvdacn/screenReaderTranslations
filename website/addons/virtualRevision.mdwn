[[!meta title="VirtualRevision"]]

* Authors: Rui Batista and NVDA Addon Team
*   Download: [development version 2.0-dev][1]

This Addon allows NVDA users to review a Window content in a text box, similar to window virtualization of JAWS for Windows.
Note, however, that this is just a convenience for users and "does not" replace NVDA's excellent review modes and object navigation support.

## Usage ##

Press NVDA+control+w to open the virtual revision Window.
Then simply navigate the shown textbox as you do in any other text content.
You can press Escape to close the virtual revision window.
