"This addon allows easy switching of synthesizers via hotkeys.  It is an "
"improved version of my earlier switch_synth addon with an underscore, which "
"must be uninstalled. Any preexisting synthesizer configurations will "
"continue to work with this version."

"There are 6 synthesizer slots, 1 through 6. By default, they are empty.  "
"Slots can be switched by pressing control+shift+NVDA+1 through "
"control+shift+NVDA+6.  Once a slot is switched to, its synthesizer and "
"settings will be loaded if they exist.  To save the current synthesizer and "
"its settings to the currently active slot, press control+shift+NVDA+v."
