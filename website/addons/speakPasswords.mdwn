This addon allows NVDA to speak typed characters and words while typing into password fields.
However, navigation in password fields is unchanged.

## Usage
Passwords are spoken automatically when this addon is installed, controlled by Speak typed characters and Speak typed words.

To stop passwords from being spoken, disable Speak typed characters/words or disable/uninstall the addon.
