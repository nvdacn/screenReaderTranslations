"An updated version of the Clip Copy add-on, initially created by Tyler "
"Spivey.  The add-on allows you to review the most recent 100 items spoken by "
"NVDA, as well as copy the selected item to the clipboard.  By default, use "
"Shift+F11 to move back through the history, Shift+F12 to move forwards and "
"F12 on its own to copy the selected item.  These hotkeys can be updated from "
"within the Speech category of NVDA's Input gestures dialog."
