[[!meta title="NVDA Add-ons discussion forum is now hosted at Groups.IO"]]

Since May 2013, the NVDA Add-ons Central at Freelists served as a one-stop location for discussing add-ons and posting release announcements. However, due to numerous issues, it was decided to move the discussion forum to Groups.IO. Thus, from July 1, 2017, the official add-ons list addresses are:

* Mailing list website: https://nvda-addons.groups.io/g/nvda-addons
* Subscribe: Send a blank email to: nvda-addons+subscribe@groups.io

The old Freelists list is hereby deprecated. Thank you.
