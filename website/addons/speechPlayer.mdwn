NV Speech Player is a free and open-source speech synthesizer currently being developed by NV Access, that strives to provide a voice similar to Eloquence or Dectalk. This Klatt-based formant synthesizer is currently in the prototype stage, but, NV Access welcomes testing by the community, so that it can be further enhanced. NV Speech Player only speaks in English, but there are plans to extend it to other languages, once work on English is fully complete. You can read more about NV Speech Player, and download a copy, at the NV Speech Player project page.
