"I always wanted to create musical tunes with NVDA, rather than just "
"listening to NVDA's progress and error beeps. However, it's not too easy to "
"do, so first I wanted to make it easier. That's why I wrote Tone Master. "
"Just imagine how it could be for you to hear NVDA playing song by Mozzart or "
"Beethoven, or may be greatest hits by Rolling Stones. Although the final "
"result sounds like those ringtones on old mobile phones, it may still be "
"funny."

"Tone Master simplifies process of playing tone sequences by implementing "
"tone data files. These files can be edited with your favorite text editor "
"and then saved for playback with NVDA. Read on for instructions!"

"Before you can play your first musical tune with Tone Master, you have to "
"create and load your tone data file first. Tone data files are simply text "
"files with .tdf extension. Tone Master uses these files for processing and "
"playing back tone sequences. To create tone data file for Tone Master to be "
"able to play it successfully, you have to follow simple rules described "
"below."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '1. '
msgid ""
"Each line in .tdf file *must* contain three parameters separated by colon "
"(:). The first parameter is tone pitch, the second parameter is tone "
"duration, and the third one is the time of silence between each tone. All "
"three parameters are necessary to specify, otherwise Tone Master will not be "
"able to play your tone data."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '2. '

"Pitch and duration parameters must be specified as signed integers, and the "
"silence must be specified as floating point real value."

"In this example, the first tone in a sequence has a pitch of 1500, duration "
"of 100 and 0.5 silence. The second tone's pitch is 1000, duration is 100, "
"and the silence is 0.09. The last tone in a sequence has pitch 500, duration "
"100, and the silence is 0.7."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Note, the silence parameter is necessary to specify even if you think that "
"it's not, because if not specified, NVDA will override the previous tone by "
"the next one, and you will get unexpectable results. That's why I made it to "
"be necessary."
