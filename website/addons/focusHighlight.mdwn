By drawing a colored rectangle, this addon enables partially sighted users, sighted educators, or developers to track the location of the nvda navigator object and the focused object/control.

The following colors are used by this addon:

* Green jagged line, to indicate the navigator object.
* Red thin rectangle, to indicate the focused object/control.
* Red thick rectangle, to indicate when navigator object and focused object are overlapping.
* Blue thick rectangle with thin slashes, to indicate NVDA is in focus mode, i.e. key types are passed to the control.

To disable object tracking, uninstall the addon.
