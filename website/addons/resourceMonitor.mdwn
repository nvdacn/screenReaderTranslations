## Usage notes ##

This add-on does not replace task manager and other system information programs for Windows. Also note the following:

* CPU usage is given for logical processors, not physical cores. This is noticeable for processors which uses Hyper Threading where number of CPU's is twice the number of CPU cores.
* There might be a short delay when getting processor usage information.
