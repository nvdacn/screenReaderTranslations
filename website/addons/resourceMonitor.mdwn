[[!meta title="Resource Monitor"]]

* Authors: Alex Hall, Joseph Lee, beqa gozalishvili and other NVDA contributors
* Version: [3.1][1]

This plugin gives information about CPU load, memory usage and other resource usage information.

Important: Resource Monitor 3.1 is not compatible with NvDA 2013.3 or earlier. If you use 2013.3 or earlier, please use Resource Monitor 3.0.

# Shortcuts #

* NVDA+Shift+E Presents used ram, average processor load, and battery info if available.
* NVDA+Shift+1 Presents the average processor load and if multicore CPU's are present the load of each core.
* NVDA+Shift+2/5 Presents the used and total space for both physical and virtual ram.
* NVDA+Shift+3 Presents the used and total space of the static and removable drives.
* NVDA+Shift+4 Presents battery percentage, charging status, remaining time (if not charging), and a warning if the battery is low or critical.
* NVDA+Shift+6 Presents  CPU Architecture 32/64-bit and Windows version and service pack numbers.

If you have NvDA 2013.3 or later installed, you can change these shortcut keys.

## Usage notes ##

This add-on does not replace task manager and other system information programs for Windows. Also note the following:

* CPU usage is given for logical processors, not physical cores. This is noticeable for processors which uses Hyper Threading where number of CPU's is twice the number of CPU cores.
* There might be a short delay when getting processor usage information.
