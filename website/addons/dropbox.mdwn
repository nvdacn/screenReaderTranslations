Dropbox is a file backup service that allows you to upload and download files for safekeeping or for sharing purposes.
It also allows you to let others download your hosted files using a download link.
This add-on for NVDA allows Dropbox client users to hear the progress of file uploads and downloads.

Note from Joseph L: I think we need more info from add-on writer as well.
