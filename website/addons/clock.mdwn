	*	The first two Combo Box controls allow you to choose your prefered time and date display formats.
	*	The third Combo Box control allows you to set the interval for automatic time announcement i.e. every 15 minutes, every 30 minutes, or every hour.
	*	When done, tab to the OK button and activate it to save your settings.
*	Press NVDA+F12 once to get current time, twice to get current date, or thrice to get the current day and week number of the current year.
