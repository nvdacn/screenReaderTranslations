# Switch synth #

This addon allows easy switching of synthesizers via hotkeys.
It is an improved version of my earlier switch_synth addon with an underscore, which must be uninstalled. Any preexisting synthesizer configurations will continue to work with this version.

There are 6 synthesizer slots, 1 through 6. By default, they are empty.
Slots can be switched by pressing control+shift+NVDA+1 through control+shift+NVDA+6.
Once a slot is switched to, its synthesizer and settings will be loaded if they exist.
To save the current synthesizer and its settings to the currently active slot, press control+shift+NVDA+v.
