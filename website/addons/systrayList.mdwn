This plugin makes possible to read and activate icons on the system tray within a list box for easy access to those items. With the plugin installed press NVDA+f11 for this dialog to pop-up.

Note that you can access the windows sysstem tray in any screenreader software using the windows+b shortcut key. This plugin is only useful to make the transition from JAWS for Windows smoother and to avoid some tooltips that may pop-up when cycling through the system tray with the windows keyboard means.
