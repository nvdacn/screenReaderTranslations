"This addon is used for saving and searching specific text strings or "
"bookmarks. It can be used  on web pages or documents in NVDA's browse mode. "
"It can also be used for saving or searching strings of text in multi-line "
"controls; in this case, if it's not possible to update the caret, the "
"corresponding string will be copied to the clipboard, so that it can be "
"searched using other tools.  The plugin saves the specified strings and "
"bookmarks to files whose name is based on the title and URL of the current "
"document.  This addon is based on SpecificSearch and Bookmark&Search, "
"developed by the same author. You should uninstall them to use this one, "
"since they have common keystrokes and features."
