"This add-on uses NVDA's in-built braille input support.  Therefore, the "
"input table used is that specified in NVDA's Braille Settings dialog.  NVDA "
"only supports computer braille input at present, so this limitation also "
"applies to this add-on."

"Some keyboards, particularly laptop keyboards, cannot handle certain "
"combinations of keys being pressed.  When this happens, certain keys are "
"simply ignored.  Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to fix "
"this, as the keys are simply never received by Windows or NVDA.  In some "
"cases, using the upper row of keys with either or both hands might help, as "
"your keyboard may allow these keys."
