NVDA will either place you at the song if found or will display an error if it cannot find the song you're looking for. To find a previously entered song or artist, press NVDA+F3 or NVDA+Shift+F3 to find forward or backward.

Note: Track Finder is case-sensitive.

## Cart Explorer

Depending on edition, SPL Studio allows up to 96 carts to be assigned for playback. NVDA allows you to hear which cart, or jingle is assigned to these commands.

To learn cart assignments, from SPL Studio, press Control+NVDA+3. Pressing the cart command once will tell you which jingle is assigned to the command. Pressing the cart command twice will play the jingle. Press Control+NvDA+3 to exit cart explorer. See the add-on guide for more information on cart explorer.

## Track Dial

You can use arrow keys to review various information about a track. To turn Track Dial on, while a track is focused in the main playlist viewer, press the command you assigned for toggling Track Dial. Then use left and right arrow keys to review information such as artist, duration and so on. Alternatively, press Control+Alt+left or right arrows to navigate between columns without invoking Track Dial.

## Track time analysis

To obtain length to play selected tracks, mark current track for start of track time analysis (SPL Assistant, F9), then press SPL Assistant, F10 when reaching end of selection.

## Columns Explorer

By pressing SPL Assistant, 1 through 0 (6 for Studio 5.01 and earlier), you can obtain contents of specific columns. By default, these are artist, title, duration, intro, category and filename (Studio 5.10 adds year, album, genre and time scheduled). You can configure which columns will be explored via columns explorer dialog found in add-on settings dialog.

## Configuration dialog

From studio window, you can press Control+NVDA+0 to open the add-on configuration dialog. Alternatively, go to NVDA's preferences menu and select SPL Studio Settings item. This dialog is also used to manage broadcast profiles.

## SPL touch mode

If you are using Studio on a touchscreen computer running Windows 8 or later and have NVDA 2012.3 or later installed, you can perform some Studio commands from the touchscreen. First use three finger tap to switch to SPL mode, then use the touch commands listed above to perform commands.

## Changes for 7.1

* When answering "no" when resetting add-on settings, you'll be returned to add-on settings dialog and NVDA will remember instant switch profile setting.
* NVDA will ask you to reconfigure stream labels and other encoder options if encoder configuration file becomes corrupted.

## Changes for 7.0

* Added add-on update check feature. This can be done manually (SPL Assistant, Control+Shift+U) or automatically (configurable via advanced options dialog from add-on settings).
* It is no longer required to stay in the playlist viewer window in order to invoke most SPL Assistant layer commands or obtain time announcements such as remaining time for the track and broadcaster time.
* Changes to SPL Assistant commands, including playlist duration (D), reassignment of hour selection duration from Shift+H to Shift+S and Shift+H now used to announce duration of remaining tracks for the current hour slot, metadata streaming status command reassigned (1 through 4, 0 is now Shift+1 through Shift+4, Shift+0).
* It is now possible to invoke track finder via SPL Assistant (F).
* SPL Assistant, numbers 1 through 0 (6 for Studio 5.01 and earlier) can be used to announce specific column information. These column slots can be changed under Columns Explorer item in add-on settings dialog.
