## SPL Controller

The SPL Controller is a set of layered commands you can use to control SPL Studio anywhere. Press the SPL Controller layer command, and NVDA will say, "SPL Controller." Press another command to control various Studio settings such as microphone on/off or play the next track.

Five seconds before the current track ends, NVDA will play a short beep to indicate that the track is about to end. This works anywhere (even within SPL Studio window). Press Control+NVDA+2 to configure this between 1 and 59 seconds.

## Track Finder

If you wish to quickly find a song by an artist or by song name, from track lisst, press Control+NVDA+F. Type the name of the artist or the song name. NVDA will either place you at the song if found or will display an error if it cannot find the song you're looking for.

To learn cart assignments, from SPL Studio, press Control+NVDA+3. Pressing the cart command once will tell you which jingle is assigned to the command. Pressing the cart command twice will play the jingle. Press Control+NvDA+3 to exit cart explorer. See the add-on guide for more information on cart explorer.
