* Press E to get count and labels for encoders being monitored.
* Press F1 to show a help dialog which lists available commands.

## End of track alarm

Five seconds before the current track ends, NVDA will play a short beep to indicate that the track is about to end. This works anywhere (even within SPL Studio window). Press Control+NVDA+2 to configure this between 1 and 59 seconds.

## Song intro alarm

If you have configured song intro time via Track Tool, NVDA will beep when the vocals are about to begin. From Studio window, press Alt+NVDA+2 to configure song intro alarm between 1 and 9 seconds.

## Microphone alarm

You can ask NVDA to play a sound when microphone has been active for a while. Press Control+NVDA+4 to configure alarm time in seconds (0 disables it).

## Track Finder

If you wish to quickly find a song by an artist or by song name, from track list, press Control+NVDA+F. Type the name of the artist or the song name. NVDA will either place you at the song if found or will display an error if it cannot find the song you're looking for. To find a previously entered song or artist, press NVDA+F3 or NVDA+Shift+F3 to find forward or backward.

Note: Track Finder is case-sensitive.

## Cart Explorer

Depending on edition, SPL Studio allows up to 96 carts to be assigned for playback. NVDA allows you to hear which cart, or jingle is assigned to these commands.

To learn cart assignments, from SPL Studio, press Control+NVDA+3. Pressing the cart command once will tell you which jingle is assigned to the command. Pressing the cart command twice will play the jingle. Press Control+NvDA+3 to exit cart explorer. See the add-on guide for more information on cart explorer.

## Track Dial

You can use arrow keys to review various information about a track. To turn Track Dial on, while a track is focused in the main playlist viewer, press the command you assigned for toggling Track Dial. Then use left and right arrow keys to review information such as artist, duration and so on.

## Configuration dialog

From studio window, you can press Control+NVDA+0 to open the add-on configuration dialog. Alternatively, go to NVDA's preferences menu and select SPL Studio Settings item.

## SPL touch mode

If you are using Studio on a touchscreen computer running Windows 8 or later and have NVDA 2012.3 or later installed, you can perform some Studio commands from the touchscreen. First use three finger tap to switch to SPL mode, then use the touch commands listed above to perform commands.

## Changes for 5.3
