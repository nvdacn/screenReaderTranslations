This add-on package provides improved usage of Station Playlist Studio, as well as providing utilities to control the Studio from anywhere.

## Unassigned commands ##

The following commands are not assigned by default; if you wish to assign it, use Input Gestures dialog to add custom commands.

Note: Input Gestures dialog is available in 2013.3 or later.

## SPL Assistant layer

This layer command set allows you to obtain various status on SPL Studio, such as whether a track is playing, total duration of all tracks for the hour and so on. From SPL Studio window, press the SPL Assistant layer command, then press one of the keys from the list below.

The available status information are:

* A: Automation.
* H: Duration of music for the current hour slot.
* Shift+H: Total duration of selected tracks for this hour slot (from the track list, press SPACE to select or uncheck the track to play).
* L: Line in.
* M: Microphone.
* P: Playback status (playing or stopped).
* R: Record to file enabled/disabled.
* T: Cart edit mode on/off.
* U: Studio up time.

## SPL Controller ##

The SPL Controller is a set of layered commands you can use to control SPL Studio anywhere. Press the SPL Controller layer command, and NVDA will say, "SPL Controller." Press another command to control various Studio settings such as microphone on/off or play the next track.

The available SPL Controller commands are:

* Press P to play the next selected track.
* Press U to pause or unpause playback.
* Press S to stop the track with fade out, or to stop the track instantly, press T.
* Press M or Shift+M to turn on or off the microphone, respectively.
* Press A to enable automation or Shift+A to disable it.
* Press L to enable line-in input or Shift+L to disable it.

## End of track alarm ##

Five seconds before the current track ends, NVDA will play a short beep to indicate that the track is about to end. This works anywhere (even within SPL Studio window). Press Control+NVDA+2 to configure this between 1 and 59 seconds.

## Track Finder ##

If you wish to quickly find a song by an artist or by song name, from track lisst, press Control+NVDA+F. Type the name of the artist or the song name. NVDA will either place you at the song if found or will display an error if it cannot find the song you're looking for. To find a previously entered song or artist, press NVDA+F3 or NVDA+Shift+F3 to find forward or backward.

Note: Track Finder is case-sensitive.

## Changes for 2.1

* You can now switch to SPL Studio even with all windows minimized (may not work in some cases).

* Correct names of combo boxes are now announced by NVDA (e.g. Options dialog and initial SPL setup screens).
* Fixed an issue where NVDA was announcing wrong information when trying to get remaining time for a track in SPL Studio 5.
