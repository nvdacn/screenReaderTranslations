This add-on helps to improve accessibility of eMule with nVDA.
Also provides additional keyboard commands for moving in different windows and gives Useful information of eMule.

It's based on eMuleNVDASupport add-on, developed by the same author. You should uninstall that old add-on to use this one, since both have common keystrokes and features.

Tested on [eMule][2] 0.50a.
