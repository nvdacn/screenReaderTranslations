"* To stop dictation, press the same shortcut, and this time you will hear a "
"low pitched beep.\n"
"Note: if you do not stop the recording, it will automatically be stopped "
"after 10 seconds.\n"
"Bare in mind the shorter time interval, the higher accuracy.\n"
"* The speech will be sent to the Google speech recognition service, and when "
"the transcription is returned, NVDA will announce it.\n"
"* If the recognition is correct, press the accept shortcut, "
"NVDA+control+shift+g, and the text will be written to your cursor "
"position.\n"
"* If the recognition was not correct, simply rerecord but use a smaller "
"chunk\n"
"of words. You might need to split a long sentence into two or three "
"chunks.\n"
"* When you want to speak in a different language, simply cycle to one of "
"your languages and repeat the steps.\n"
