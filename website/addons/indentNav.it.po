"This add-on allows NVDA users to navigate by indentation level or offset of "
"lines or paragraphs.  In browsers it allows to quickly find paragraphs with "
"the same offset from the left edge of the screen, such as first level "
"comments in a hierarchical tree of comments.  Also while editing source code "
"in many programming languages, it allows to jump between the lines of the "
"same indentation level, as well as quickly find lines with greater or lesser "
"indentation level."

"IndentNav can be used to navigate by offset from the left edge of the "
"screen.  IN particular, you can press NVDA+Alt+DownArrow or UpArrow to jump "
"to the next or previous paragraph that has the same offset.  For example, "
"this can be useful when browsing hierarchical trees of comments (e.g. on "
"reddit.com) to jump between first level comments and skipping all the higher "
"level comments."

"IndentNav can also be useful for editing source code in many programming "
"languages.  Languages like Python require the source code to be properly "
"indented, while in many other programming languages it is strongly "
"recommended.  With IndentNav you can press NVDA+Alt+DownArrow or UpArrow to "
"jump to next or previous line with the same indentation level.  You can also "
"press NVDA+Alt+LeftArrow to jump to a parent line, that is a previous line "
"with lower indentation level.  In Python you can easily find current "
"function definition or class definition.  You can also press NVDA+Alt"
"+RightArrow to go to the first child of current line, that is next line with "
"greater indentation level."
