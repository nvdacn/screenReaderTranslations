msgid "This add-on uses NVDA's in-built braille input support.  Therefore, the input table used is that specified in NVDA's Braille Settings dialog.  NVDA only supports computer braille input at present, so this limitation also applies to this add-on."

msgid "Some keyboards, particularly laptop keyboards, cannot handle certain combinations of keys being pressed.  When this happens, certain keys are simply ignored.  Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done to fix this, as the keys are simply never received by Windows or NVDA.  In some cases, using the upper row of keys with either or both hands might help, as your keyboard may allow these keys."
