"information from the editor and to determine the caret position. This is "
"specially beneficial when the user needs to move around on the screen, even "
"in white spaces. When the \"Flat Mode\" is set to \"off\", text rendering on "
"the braille display is more stable, since NVDA uses Windows API to retrieve "
"it. However when the the caret is moved in white spaces next to the end of "
"the line of text, the braille display does not follow the real cursor as long "

"Character-by-character reporting: Normally, when working with maths you would "

"window or one of its variants (the six dots representation, for example); "
"press NVDA+2 (number two) or navigate to NVDA menu>Preferences>Keyboard "
"settings and check the box to Speak typed characters; go to "
"LAMBDA>Options>Voice paramethers and ensure the checkbox \"echo\" is ON, "
"otherwhise NVDA won't receive anything from the speech engine while you are "
"typing. And done, NVDA will speak written characters, but don't worry, only "
"in LAMBDA or its special windows, the settings for the rest of applications "
"will be left as they were."
