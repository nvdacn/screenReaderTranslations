"This addon reverts the behaviour of NVDA+f9 and NVDA+f10 that was introduced "
"in NVDA 2016.3."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The old behaviour copies the selection to the clipboard on the first press "
"of NVDA+f10, while the new one selects on the first press and copies on the "
"second.  The new behaviour has some disadvantages. Text can't be copied "
"without being selected (and thus moving the cursor), where that's "
"available. For places it's not (example the console), it adds an extra press "
"of NVDA+f10."

"The addon adds two new gestures under the Classic Selection category to "
"start and end selection, which are bound to NVDA+f9 and NVDA+f10 by default."
