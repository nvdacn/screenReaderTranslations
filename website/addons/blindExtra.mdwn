This add-on allowed access to certain extra software.

In November 2016, this add-on was flagged as a remote access Trojan (remotely accessing another computer and damaging files without users knowing it) by members of the NVDA add-ons community for the following reasons:

* Renaming files after using it for a while without users noticing it.
* Remote access, including sending Skype messages.

Note: this add-on was never hosted on community add-ons website.

The add-ons community urges NVDA users to uninstall this add-on. The add-ons community would also like to remind users to be careful when installing add-ons from untrusted sources, as NVDA add-ons can perform various things, including accessing the file system and the Internet. Thank you.
