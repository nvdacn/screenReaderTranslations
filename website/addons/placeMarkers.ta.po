"This addon is used for saving and searching specific text strings or "
"bookmarks, on web pages or documents in NVDA's browse mode. It can also be "
"used for saving or searching strings of text in multi-line controls; in this "
"case, if it's not possible to update the caret, the corresponding string "
"will be copied to the clipboard, so that it can be searched using other "
"tools.  The plugin saves the specified strings and bookmarks to text and "
"pickle files. The name of these files is based on the title and URL of the "
"current document."
