This add-on improves accessibility of TeamViewer with NVDA.

It's based on TeamViewerNVDASupport add-on, developed by the same author. You should uninstall that old add-on to use this one, since both have common keystrokes and features.

Tested on [TeamViewer][3] 9, trial version.

## Key Commands: ##

*	nvda+shift+C: Copies the ID and current password to the clipboard, so that they can be pasted and sent via chat for example when remote control is required.
*	control+tab and control+shift+tab: Switch to other tab in the TeamViewer main dialog.

## Changes for 2.0 ##
*	 Add-on help is available from the Add-ons Manager.

## Changes for 1.0 ##
