"NV Speech Player is a free and open-source speech synthesizer currently "
"being developed by NV Access, that strives to provide a voice similar to "
"Eloquence or Dectalk. This Klatt-based formant synthesizer is currently in "
"the prototype stage, but, NV Access welcomes testing by the community, so "
"that it can be further enhanced. NV Speech Player only speaks in English, "
"but there are plans to extend it to other languages, once work on English is "
"fully complete. You can read more about NV Speech Player, and download a "
"copy, at the NV Speech Player project page."
