[[!meta title="Classic Selection"]]

This addon reverts the behaviour of NVDA+f9 and NVDA+f10 that was introduced in NVDA 2016.3.

The old behaviour copies the selection to the clipboard on the first press of NVDA+f10, while the new one selects on the first press and copies on the second.
The new behaviour has some disadvantages. Text can't be copied without being selected (and thus moving the cursor), where that's available. For places it's not (example the console), it adds an extra press of NVDA+f10.

The addon adds two new gestures under the Classic Selection category to start and end selection, which are bound to NVDA+f9 and NVDA+f10 by default.
