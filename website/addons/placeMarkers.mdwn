This addon is used for saving and searching specific text strings or bookmarks, on web pages or documents in NVDA's browse mode. It can also be used for saving or searching strings of text in multi-line controls; in this case, if it's not possible to update the caret, the corresponding string will be copied to the clipboard, so that it can be searched using other tools.
The plugin saves the specified strings and bookmarks to text and pickle files. The name of these files is based on the title and URL of the current document.

This addon is based on SpecificSearch and Bookmark&Search, developed by the same author. You should uninstall them to use this one, since they have common keystrokes and features.

## Key Commands: ##

*	control+shift+NVDA+s; Opens a dialog that allows you to save a text string   you want to find in the current document. By default, the text previously saved for this file is shown. Delete this text and press Ok button if you wish to remove the text file corresponding to the saved search, or type new text to add another search.
*	control+shift+NVDA+f; opens a dialog with a edit box that shows the last saved search; in this dialog you can also select the previously saved searches from a combo box and choose an action from the next combo box. If there is no available files for specific search in the current document, NVDA will warn you that it is not found any file for specific search.
*	control+shift+NVDA+k; Saves the current position as a bookmark
*	control+shift+NVDA+delete; Deletes the bookmark corresponding to this position.
*	NVDA+k; Moves to the next bookmark.
*	shift+NVDA+k; Moves to the previous bookmark.
*	control+shift+k; Copies to clipboard the file name, without extension, where the place markers data will be saved.

## Place markers Submenu (NVDA+N) ##


Using Place markers submenu, under Preferences menu, you can access:

*	Specific search folder: opens a folder of specific searches previously saved.
*	Bookmarks folder; opens a folder of the saved bookmarks.
*	Copy placeMarkers folder; you can save a copy of the bookmarks folder.
*	Restore placeMarkers; you can restore your bookmarks from a previously saved placeMarkers folder .
*	Documentation file, in your selected language if available, or English by default.

Note: The bookmark position is based on the number of characters; and therefore in pages with a dynamic content is better to use the specific search, and not the bookmarks which save a precise position.
