Using this add-on, spoken text containing emoticon characters will be replaced by its more human friendly description.
86 emoticons are defined.

For example: ":)" will be spoken as "smiling smiley", or ":D" will be spoken as "laughing smiley"

You can take advantage of the following features:

## Insert smiley ##

When you are unsure of the characters for a particular smiley, this addon enables you to select and insert it into your text such as in a chat.
Press NVDA+I, or from menu Preferences -> Manage emoticons -> Insert smiley, to open a dialog 
with the provided smilies.
When you press OK, the characters for the chosen smiley will be copied to your clipboard, ready for pasting.


## Customize emoticons ##

From NVDA MENU, Preferences -> Manage emoticons -> Customize emoticons, you can open a dialog setting to add or to edit available emoticons.
This dialog allows you to save an emoticons speech  dictionary  with your customizations.

Pressing "Save and export dictionary" button, a file dictionary named emoticons.dic will be saved in your user config folder, speechDicts subfolder.


## Activation settings ##

You can choose whether to Activate speaking of emoticons when starting NVDA. By default it is disabled.
It is also possible to save your choice for this setting.
