"Starting from the addon version 1.1.0, there are two ways in which the text "
"in the Lambda editor is rendered: \"Flat mode\" and \"non-Flat Mode\". When "
"the \"Flat mode\" is on, NVDA will use the Display Model to retrieve "
"information from the editor and to determine the caret position. This is "
"specially beneficial when the user needs to move around on the screen, even "
"in white spaces. When the \"Flat Mode\" is set to \"off\", text rendering on "
"the braille display is more stable, since NVDA uses Windows API to retrieve "
"it. However when the the caret is moved in white spaces next to the end of "
"the line of text, the braille display does not follow the real cursor as "
"long as a non-white space is added by the user."
