This package contains a driver for the apolo2 / Juno series of hardware synthecisers from Dolphin Ltd.
You can find information about these hardware synthecisers in the manual, at[2]


These synthecisers are connected to the PC using a RS 232 Serial communications port.
If your machine don't have a serial port (most new computers don't) you may aquire a USB to serial convertal, which works as well.
 
## Usage

After add-on installation, you must set the serial port that will be used to talk with the apolo or Juno.
To do so, go to NVDA menu > preferences > Apolo 2 / Juno settings, and select the proper communications port from the list.


## Limitations

This driver only supports basic settings: volume, rate and pitch.
Neither voice or ROM selection is supported, as well as the indexing functionality.
