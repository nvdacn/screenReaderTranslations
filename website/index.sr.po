"[NVDA][1] is a very flexible and extensible screen reader.  NVDA add-ons are "
"additional packages that can be downloaded and installed into your copy of "
"NVDA to enhance existing functionality or add additional features.  On these "
"pages, you will find add-ons that have been created and publicly reviewed by "
"members of the community.  Please note that many of these add-ons are not "
"provided by NV Access, so NV Access cannot be held responsible for these "
"add-ons,"

"To install an add-on, go to the NVDA tools menu, then select manage "
"add-ons.  Then select install, navigate to the location where you saved the "
"downloaded add-on and choose the add-on package you wish to install.  "
"Alternatively, if you installed 2012.3 or later on your computer, using file "
"manager of your choice, navigate to the location where you stored the "
"add-on, then press ENTER on the nvda-addon file you wish to install.  Once "
"you press Open or press ENTER on the add-on file, NVDA will ask if you "
"really wish to install the add-on.  As the functionality of add-ons is "
"unrestricted inside NVDA, which in theory could include accessing your "
"personal data or even the entire system if NVDA is an installed copy, it is "
"very important to only install add-ons from sources you trust.  Once the "
"add-on is installed, NVDA must be restarted for the add-on to start running."
