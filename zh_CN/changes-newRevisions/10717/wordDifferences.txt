+{Highlights of this release include browse mode for documents in Microsoft Word and Outlook; major enhancements to support for Skype for Desktop; and significant fixes for Microsoft Internet Explorer.}+

== New Features ==
- You can now add new symbols in the Symbol Pronunciation dialog. (#4354)

- Quick navigation -{(h for heading etc) plus}- +{(pressing h to move by heading, etc.) and}+ Elements List (NVDA+f7) are now available in Microsoft Word documents by turning on browse mode with NVDA+space. (#2975)
- Reading HTML messages in Microsoft Outlook 2007 and -{higher}- +{later}+ has been majorly improved as Browse mode is automatically enabled for these messages. If browse mode is not enabled in some rare situations, you can force it on with NVDA+space. (#2975)
- Table column headers in Microsoft word are automatically reported for tables where a header row has been explicitly specified by the author via Microsoft word's table properties. (#4510)
 - However, For tables where rows have been -{merged}- +{merged,}+ this will not work automatically. In this -{situation}- +{situation,}+ you can still set column headers manually in NVDA with NVDA+shift+c.
- In Skype for Desktop, notifications are now reported. (#4741)
- In Skype for Desktop, you can now report and review recent messages using NVDA+control+1 through NVDA+control+0; e.g. NVDA+control+1 for the most recent message and NVDA+control+0 for the tenth most recent. (#3210)
- In a conversation in Skype for Desktop, NVDA now reports when a contact is typing. (#3506)

- NVDA can now be installed silently via the -{commandline with out it}- +{command line without}+ starting the installed copy after installation. To do this, use -{--install-silent.}- +{the --install-silent option.}+ (#4206)

== Changes ==
- In NVDA's Document Formatting settings dialog, the option to report spelling errors now has a shortcut key (alt+r). (#793)

- NVDA will now use the synthesizer/voice's language for character and symbol processing (including -{punctuation symbol}- +{punctuation/symbol}+ names), regardless of whether automatic language switching is turned on. To turn off this feature so that NVDA again uses its interface language, uncheck the new option in Voice settings called Trust Voice's language when processing characters and symbols. (#4210)
- Support for the Newfon synthesizer has been removed. Newfon is now available as an NVDA add-on. (#3184)
- Skype for Desktop 7 or later is now required for use with NVDA; earlier versions are not supported. (#4218)
- Downloading of NVDA updates is now more secure. (Specifically, the update information is retrieved via https and the hash of the file is verified after it is downloaded.) (#4716)
