    In Microsoft Excel, NVDA no longer ignores a column header for a cell when there is a blank row between the cell and the header.
    Also, coordinates are now announced before headers to eliminate ambiguity between headers and content.
    
    * Don't limit entirely to region. Rather:
    * Don't allow matching on row or column headers in a different region horizontally.
    * Always search for column and row headers  by row (I.e. the closest row first).
    * Refuse to find column headers when on a column header, or row headers when on a row header.
    
    Fixes #5396.
