 - "scons tests" now checks that translatable strings have translator comments. You can also run this alone with "scons checkPot". (#7492)
 - There is now a new extensionPoints module which provides a generic framework to enable code extensibility at specific points in the code. This allows interested parties to register to be notified when some action occurs (extensionPoints.Action), to modify a specific kind of data (extensionPoints.Filter) or to participate in deciding whether something will be done (extensionPoints.Decider). (#3393)
 - You can now register to be notified about configuration profile switches via the config.configProfileSwitched Action. (#3393)
+- Braille display gestures that emulate system keyboard key modifiers (such as control and alt) can now be combined with other emulated system keyboard keys without explicit definition. (#6213) 
+ - For example: if you have a key on your display bound to the alt key and another display key to downArrow, combining these keys will result in the emulation of alt+downArrow.
