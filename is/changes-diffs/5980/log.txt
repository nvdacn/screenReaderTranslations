message:
  eSpeak synthDriver:  when speaking characters in character mode, use the correct ssml markup that eSpeak understands, rather than a Microsoft variant which never worked. eSpeak will now announce the value of unknown letters rather than just 'symbol' or 'letter' due to this change. Fixes #3106
