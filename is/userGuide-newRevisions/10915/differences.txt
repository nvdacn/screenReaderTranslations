 All Focus and PAC Mate displays from [Freedom Scientific http://www.freedomscientific.com/] are supported when connected via USB or bluetooth.
 You will need the Freedom Scientific braille display drivers installed on your system.

 Although this page only mentions the Focus Blue display, the drivers support all Freedom Scientific Focus and Pacmate displays.
 If your system is running 64 bit Windows and the drivers were already installed by another screen reader, you will probably still need to install the drivers from this link, as the files required by NVDA were probably not installed by the other screen reader.
