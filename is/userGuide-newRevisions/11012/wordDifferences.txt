+{+ Reading Mathematical Content +
Using MathPlayer 4 from Design Science, NVDA can read and interactively navigate supported mathematical content.
This requires that MathPlayer 4 is installed on the computer.
MathPlayer is available as a free download from: http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/

NVDA supports the following types of mathematical content:
- MathML in Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
- Design Science MathType in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.
- MathML in Adobe Reader. Note that this is not an official standard yet, so there is currently no publicly available software that can produce this content.
-

When reading a document, NVDA will speak any supported mathematical content where it occurs.
If you are using a braille display, it will also be displayed in braille.

++ Interactive Navigation ++
If you are working primarily with speech, in most cases, you will probably wish to examine the expression in smaller segments, rather than hearing the entire expression at once.

If you are in browse mode, you can do this by moving the cursor to the mathematical content and pressing enter.

If you are not in browse mode:
+ move the review cursor to the mathematical content.
By default, the review cursor follows the system caret, so you can usually use the system caret to move to the desired content.
+ Then, activate the following command:
+

%kc:beginInclude
|| Name | Key | Description |
| Interact with math content | NVDA+alt+m | Begins interaction with math content. |
%kc:endInclude

At this point, you can use MathPlayer commands such as the arrow keys to explore the expression.
For example, you can move through the expression with the left and right arrow keys and zoom into a portion of the expression such as a fraction using the down arrow key.
Please see the MathPlayer documentation for further information.

When you wish to return to the document, simply press the escape key.}+

+ Application Specific NVDA Commands +
NVDA provides its own extra commands for some applications to make certain tasks easier or to provide access to functionality which is not otherwise accessible to screen reader users.
