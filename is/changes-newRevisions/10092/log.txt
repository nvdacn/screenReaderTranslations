    In certain lists in iTunes such as the Music list, moving to the next item using object navigation now works correctly.
    
    accNavigate isn't supported, so we use child count and child ids. Unfortunately, the wrong child cout was being used, so you couldn't navigate to many items.
    Fixes #4129.
