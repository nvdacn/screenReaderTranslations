    In languages which use a space as a digit group/thousands separator such as French and German, numbers from separate chunks of text are no longer pronounced as a single number. This was particularly problematic for table cells containing numbers.
    
    speech.speak now uses CHUNK_SEPARATOR (double space) instead of a single space to separate text chunks in speech sequences.
    Fixes #3698.
