    It is now possible to change the shortcut key used to start NVDA for locales where the normal shortcut causes problems.
    
    This is done via gettext.
    Note that the text for the Create desktop shortcut option in the Install NVDA dialog, as well as the shortcut key in the User Guide, must also be updated.
    Fixes #2209.
