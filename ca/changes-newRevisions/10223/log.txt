    In Google Chrome, the title of the document is again reported when switching tabs. In NVDA 2014.2, this did not occur in some cases.
    
    When determining whether focus is entering a buffer from a descendant (e.g. dismissing an ARIA dialog), we were treating another document at the same level as a descendant. Basically, this was a simple off-by-one error.
    Fixes #4222.
