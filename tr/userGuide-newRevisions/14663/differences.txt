+==== Variant ====[SpeechSettingsVariant]
 If you are using the Espeak NG synthesizer that is packaged with NVDA, this is a combo box that lets you select the Variant the synthesizer should speak with.
 ESpeak NG's Variants are rather like voices, as they provide slightly different attributes to the eSpeak NG voice.
 Some variants will sound like a male, some like a female, and some even like a frog.

 This is a slider that goes from 0 to 100, (0 being the slowest, 100 being the fastest).
 
-==== Pitch ====[VoiceSettingsPitch]
+==== Pitch ====[SpeechSettingsPitch]

+==== Automatic Language switching ====[SpeechSettingsLanguageSwitching]
 This checkbox allows you to toggle whether NVDA should switch speech synthesizer languages automatically if the text being read specifies its language.
 This option is enabled by default.
 Currently only the eSpeak NG synthesizer supports automatic language switching.
 
-==== Automatic Dialect switching ====[VoiceSettingsDialectSwitching]
+==== Automatic Dialect switching ====[SpeechSettingsDialectSwitching]
 This checkbox allows you to toggle whether or not dialect changes should be made, rather than just actual language changes.

 This option applies to all synthesizers, not just the currently active synthesizer.
 
-==== Trust voice's language for processing symbols and characters ====[VoiceSettingsTrust]
+==== Trust voice's language for processing symbols and characters ====[SpeechSettingsTrust]
 On by default, this option tells NVDA if the current voice's language can be trusted when processing symbols and characters.
 If you find that NVDA is reading punctuation in the wrong language for a particular synthesizer or voice, you may wish to turn this off to force NVDA to use its global language setting instead.
 
-==== Capital pitch change percentage ====[VoiceSettingsCapPitchChange]
+==== Capital pitch change percentage ====[SpeechSettingsCapPitchChange]
 This edit field allows you to type the amount that the pitch of the voice will change when speaking a capital letter.
 This value is a percentage, where a negative value lowers the pitch and a positive value raises it.
 For no pitch change you would use 0.
 
-==== Say "cap" before capitals ====[VoiceSettingsSayCapBefore]
+==== Say "cap" before capitals ====[SpeechSettingsSayCapBefore]
 This setting is a checkbox that, when checked, tells NVDA to say the word "cap" before any capital letter when spoken as an individual character such as when spelling.
 Usually, NVDA raises the pitch slightly for any capital letter, but some synthesizers may not support this well, so perhaps this option may be of use.
 
-==== Beep for capitals ====[VoiceSettingsBeepForCaps]
+==== Beep for capitals ====[SpeechSettingsBeepForCaps]
 If this checkbox is checked, NVDA will make a small beep each time it encounters a capitalized character by itself.
 Like the "say cap for capitals" checkbox, this is useful for Synthesizers that can't change their pitch for capital letters.
 
-==== Use spelling functionality if supported ====[VoiceSettingsUseSpelling]

 Some words consist of only one character, but the pronunciation is different depending on whether the character is being spoken as an individual character (such as when spelling) or a word.
