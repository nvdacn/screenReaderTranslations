- If NVDA falls back to eSpeak or  no speech due to a configured speech synthesizer failing when NVDA starts, the configuration is no longer updated to set the fallback synthesizer as the configured choice, meaning that now the original synthesizer will be tried again next time NVDA starts. (#2589)
- In browse mode in Mozilla applications, updates to tables are now rendered correctly. For example, in updated cells, row and column coordinates are reported and table navigation works as it should. (#2784)
- In browse mode in web browsers, certain clickable unlabelled graphics which weren't previously rendered are now rendered correctly. (#2838)

- In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, block quotes are now reported where appropriate. (#2888)
- The HumanWare Brailliant BI/B series braille display driver can now be selected when the display is connected via Bluetooth but has never been connected via USB.


== Changes for Developers ==
- Braille display drivers can now support manual port selection. (#426)
 - This is most useful for braille displays which support connection via a legacy serial port.
 - This is done using the getPossiblePorts class method on the BrailleDisplayDriver class.
- Braille input from braille keyboards is now supported. (#808)
 - Braille input is encompassed by the brailleInput.BrailleInputGesture class or a subclass thereof.
 - Subclasses of braille.BrailleDisplayGesture (as implemented in braille display drivers) can also inherit from brailleInput.BrailleInputGesture. This allows display commands and braille input to be handled by the same gesture class.
