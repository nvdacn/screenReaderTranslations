    In Microsoft Word, NVDA no longer freezes in large tables when reporting of table row/column headers is enabled.
    
    When searching for possible header rows in a table, only keep searching if the previous row was a header row. I.e.  Only the first row, and 0 or more adjacent rows can be the header rows.
    Fixes #5878.
