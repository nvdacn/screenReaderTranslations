    NVDA no longer sometimes crashes when enabling braille output.
    
    * Switch to NV Access fork of liblouis that fixes a major buffer overrun (GetModuleFilename in lou_getProgramPath). Submitted upstream as liblouis/liblouis#160.
    * sconscript for liblouis: compile with level 2 warnings. This at least could have caught the GetModuleFilename bug.
    
    Fixes #4457.
