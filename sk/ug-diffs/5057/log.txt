  Merged repackaged. NVDA is now distributed as one stand-alone executable which provides the ability to install or create a portable copy at any time. Specifically:

  	* A portable version of NVDA can now be installed by choosing Install NVDA under Tools in the NVDA menu.
  	* an installed version of NVDA can create a portable copy by choosing Create Portable Copy under Tools in the NVDA menu.
