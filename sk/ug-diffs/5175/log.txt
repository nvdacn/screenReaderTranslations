  Additions and changes to copying user configuration in the installer and create portable copy dialogs:
  * The Copy user config option in the Create Portable copy dialog is now only available if creating from an installed copy, not when creating from the Launcher package.
  * There is a new option in the Installer dialog when installing from a portable copy, allowing you to copy the portable configuration to the currently logged on user's NVDA configuration.
  * Descriptions of the new and existing installer and create portable copy dialog options are now explained in detail in the user guide.
