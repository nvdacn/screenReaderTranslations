 +++ Input Composition Settings +++
 The Input Composition Settings dialog can be found under the Preferences menu.
 This dialog allows you to control how NVDA reports the input of Asian characters, such as with IME or Text Service input methods.
-
+Note that due to the fact that input methods vary greatly by available features and by how they convey information, it will most likely be necessary to configure these options differently for each input method to get the most efficient typing experience.
+ 
 ==== Automatically report all available candidates ====
 This option, which is on by default,  allows you to choose whether or not all visible candidates should be reported automatically when a candidate list appears or its page is changed.
 Having this option on for pictographic input methods such as chinese New ChangJie or Boshiami is useful, as you can automatically hear all symbols and their numbers and you can choose one right away.
 However, for phonetic input methods such as chinese New Phonetic, it may be more useful to turn this option off, as all the symbols will sound the same and you will have to use the arrow keys to navigate the list items individually to gain more information  from the character descriptions for each candidate.
 
+==== Announce Selected Candidate ====
+This option, which is on by default, allows you to choose whether NVDA should announce the selected candidate when a candidate list appears or when the selection is changed.
+For input methods where the selection can be changed with the arrow keys  (such as Chinese New Phonetic) this is necessary, but for some input methods it may be more efficient typing with this option turned off.
+Note that even with this option off, the review cursor will still be placed on the selected candidate allowing you to use object navigation / review to manually read this or other candidates.
+
 ==== Report changes to the reading string ====
 Some input methods such as Chinese New Phonetic and New ChangJie have a reading string (sometimes known as a precomposition string).
 You can choose whether or not NVDA should announce new characters being typed into this reading string with this option.
 This option is on by default.
+Note some older input methods such as Chinese ChangJie may not use the reading string to hold precomposition characters, but instead use the composition string directly. Please see the next option for configuring reporting of the composition string.
+
+==== Report changes to the composition string ===
+After reading or precomposition data has been combined into a valid pictographic symbol, most input methods place this symbol into a composition string for temporary storage along with other combined symbols before they are finally inserted into the document.
+This option allows you to choose whether or not NVDA should report new symbols as they appear  in the composition string.
+This option is on by default.
