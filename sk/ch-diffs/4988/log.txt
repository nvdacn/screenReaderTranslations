message:
  OffsetsTextInfo.move: For UNIT_CHARACTER, allow the character to be 1 past the end, as there is often an uncounted character at the end where the caret is placed to append text.
  This means that routing the cursor to the space at the end of the line/paragraph using braille cursor routing keys in some editable text fields now works correctly instead of routing to the start of the text.
