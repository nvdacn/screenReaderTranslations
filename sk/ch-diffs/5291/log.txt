message:
  In applications using UI Automation (such as .net and Silverlight applications), the calculation of numeric values for controls such as sliders has been corrected.
  Specifically, a 0 range (e.g. min 0 and max 0) will no longer cause an exception, min values other than 0 are handled correctly and any numbers after the decimal point are now stripped.
