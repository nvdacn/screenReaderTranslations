    NVDA now correctly reports the focus when dismissing a context menu in some applications such as Jart.
    
    It seems that some applications fire menuEnd on an invalid/non-foreground/non-topmost window, so just allow menuEnd (and some other events which behave similarly) unconditionally in eventHandler.shouldAcceptEvent and let IAccessibleHandler do the filtering/translation.
    Fixes #5302.
