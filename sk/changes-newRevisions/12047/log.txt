    In Internet Explorer and other MSHTML controls, moving focus to certain controls (specifically, where aria-activedescendant is used) no longer incorrectly switches to browse mode. This occurred, for example, when moving to suggestions in address fields when composing a message in Gmail.
    
    MSHTML NVDAObject: expose focusable and focused states if this object is the active descendant of the focus as IE fails to do this itself. This code was moved from shouldAllowIAccessibleFocusEvent into states.
    Re #5676.
